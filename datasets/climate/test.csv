Empire Fire & Marine Insurance Company," This includes adjusting the risk profile in line with the companys stated risk tolerance to respond to new threats and opportunities  Zurichs risk management framework is a governance process with clear responsibilities for taking, managing, monitoring and reporting risks  This process relates to all types of risk including climate change

Zurich has a global and interdisciplinary Emerging Risk Group (ERG) that looks at potential risks, including climate-related risks 

Understanding the potential effects of natural catastrophes is a critical component of risk management  Zurich uses a combination of third-party and in-house models to manage its underwriting and accumulations in modeling areas to stay within intended exposure limits

Fidelity LIfe Association," We are also licensed for and maintain a small amount of activity in health insurance, but not major medical coverage We are not licensed for property-casualty sales in any state California and other states regulate life insurance application questions and require them to have a verifiable connection to life expectancy We recognize loss of life from climate extremes may occur, but we cannot underwrite life coverage based upon the fact an applicant resides in an area prone to such extremes and we cannot offer a discount or incentive for an applicant to change their choices concerning energy usage or relocate to a different geographic location with lower expected risks from natural disasters

"Soundpath Health, Inc","  The Company does not deem the risk of climate change to its business operations to be significant in the near term  However, the Company will continue to periodically assess how climate change could impact its business operations, and will develop a formal communication plan with key constituencies related to climate change-related risks at such point the Company determines that those risks could be significantly impactful to its business operations",6
Puritan Life Insurance Company of America," Additionally, third party administrators that service business for the company are also required to have a disaster recovery policy that includes weather related disasters",1
Steadfast Insurance Company," It includes climate-related perils, such as tropical cyclones, extra-tropical cyclones, floods and severe convective storms The model is not purely relying on a single model vendor (eg Risk Management Solutions Inc) but has the flexibility to use any vendor model's output and implement proprietary adjustments to both the severity and frequency of events to reflect the 'Zurich View' of risk Zurich aims to understand the assumptions in the models, gain a multi-model view, compare to claims experience and use internal and external insight

The time scale of the changes projected is typically over a period of several decades In the catastrophe accumulation processes Zurich is continuously adjusting to actual developments over time in a manner appropriate for the instruments modeled Catastrophe models typically are updated every five years Zurich considers the impact of climate change on a five year time horizon to be smaller than the impact of the natural climate variability (eg ENSO, AMO) and the general variability of catastrophe events

Zurich monitors emerging climate research through internal expertise and gains external insight through the Advisory Committee for Catastrophes, which is made up of world-class scientists, including an author from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Zurich joined the Risk Prediction Initiative (RPI) in 2015, which is a membership organization funding academic research relevant to re/insurance industry and translates research into usable results Several RPI projects are explicitly investigating the impact of climate change on atmospheric perils

The requirement for a Zurich View of risk is contained within Zurichs Risk and Underwriting policies and is governed through the Group Chief Underwriting Officer, the Head of Group Reinsurance and the Cat Technical Expert Group The work Zurich has done on its view of risk has in some cases led to vendor model change The model, which has grown from its initial platform developed in 2004, has been approved by the Swiss regulator, FINMA, for use under the Swiss Solvency Test as well as by the Central Bank of Ireland for use under the Solvency II regulation

When Zurich globalized Cat Management within its Underwriting area in 2010, a dedicated new function 'Cat Research & Development' was established The purpose of this function is to establish the Zurich View of risk by validating and calibrating the existing risk models and including the newest available scientific insights

Arch Mortgage Assurance Company,"  We offer loan default protection to commercial lenders who have the expertise and insight in their business segments to understand and manage potential enterprise hazards, including those influenced by climate change  In that framework, Arch MI relies on the customer's internal enterprise risk management mechanisms to appropriately identify and prepare for the losses caused them by climate-influenced events  

Nonetheless, Arch MI interacts regularly with its policyholders and promotes rigorous loss prevention and loss mitigation activity to reduce the incidence of default on insured loans  Any indirect impact on default rates resulting from climate-change will be addressed in this loss prevention activity through the rigorous application of underwriting standards related to employment, property valuation, etc",5

Great Divide Insurance Company,"  More details on the computer modeling are included in question 8  
In addition the ERM team regularly reviews pertinent scientific literature to ensure it understands current thinking on how climate change is impacting the perils that could currently or in future give rise to losses  
While it is clear that there are significant upwards trends in both economic and insured losses arising from natural catastrophes, if one normalizes the losses for changes in exposures and for societal changes these upwards trends largely disappear  For example there is no upward trend in the incidence or the intensity of the actual perils for tropical cyclone (hurricane, typhoon), tornado, flood or drought  To illustrate this point, the chart below show that over the period 1990 to 2012, global catastrophe economic losses have actually decreased as a percentage of GDP
http://rogerpielkejrblogspotcom/2013/03/graph-of-day-global-disasters-and-gdphtml
 
Similar results are seen for region-specific weather related losses normalized for exposure and societal changes using a number of different methodologies, for example population and wealth per head of population or number of housing units and wealth per household  Essentially there is a significant increase in both the number and the values of buildings and contents, oftentimes in areas that are particularly prone to weather-related catastrophes such as Gulf and Florida coastal areas 
We investigate trends in weather related losses by peril, as we recognize that the dominance of wind-related losses may disguise trends in other perils  This note is focused on North America, but similar results have been seen in a wide range of studies

Hurricane
Only a small proportion of hurricanes forming in the Atlantic Basin actually make landfall in the USA  Taking observations from 1880 onwards, there is actually a slight downward trend in the number of landfalling tropical storms and hurricanes  
The paper Tropical cyclones and climate change, authored by Thomas R Knutson, John L McBride, Johnny Chan, Kerry Emanuel, Greg Holland, Chris Landsea, Isaac Held, James P Kossin, A K Srivastava and Masato Sugi and published in Nature Geoscience in February 2010 suggests that globally we might expect to see an increase in tropical cyclones intensity of between 2% and 11% by 2100, and a decrease in landfalling frequency of between 6% and 34%  
Tornado
Tornado data is available as far back as 1950; however the older years understate the number of the least damaging EF-0 tornadoes  The introduction of Dopplar radar combined with increasing population and greater ease of recording and reporting events via cell phones and other mobile devises have greatly increased the number of EF-0 tornadoes reported  However, the number of tornadoes for categories EF-1 to EF-5 show no trend over the period from 1950 onwards losses, nor is there any trend in the proportion in each category EF-1 to EF0-5   Additionally, tornado losses show no trend once they have been normalized for exposure and societal changes

Flood
From a risk management perspective coastal flooding due to tropical cyclones is considered within our hurricane risk assessment  However we also consider riverine flood and groundwater flood   If one considers flood losses excluding storm surge associated with hurricanes (and post-tropical cyclones line Sandy), then flood losses are actually a decreasing proportion of the US GDP
Measures such as the annual mean US runoff and the percentage of streamages above bankful streamflow show no upward trend  Flood losses taken from National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA): http://wwwnwsnoaagov/hic/:

 
Drought
Within the past century, the most significant drought event was the dust bowl of the 1930s  During the last century, it is apparent that the El Nino / Southern Oscillation (ENSO) has a significant impact on the USA rainfall / drought conditions, but there is no evidence of any long-term change related to climate   
 
National Percent Area Severely to Extremely Dry:  data from National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, US National Percent Area Severely to Extremely Dry and Severely to Extremely Wet, wwwncdcnoaagov/oa/climate/research/2003/dec/uspctarea-wetdrytxt
When investigating the potential impact of climate change it is beneficial to obtain data for a longer period  NOAA has results from paleoclimatology studies that provide information on drought in North America spanning centuries   In the late 16th century there was a drought significantly more severe than anything subsequently experienced in the USA  These studies also indicate that droughts similar to the 1950s, in terms of duration and spatial extent, occurred once or twice a century for the past three centuries (for example, during the 1860s, 1820s, 1730s)
From an insurance perspective, the business line that might be most significantly and directly impacted by drought is crop insurance  Berkley insurance companies do not currently offer this coverage
Wildfire
The chart below shows acres burned per year from 1931 to 2003  It considers only protected land; if we consider all acres burned there is a very material decreasing trend   http://viewofficeappslivecom/op/viewaspx?src=http%3A%2F%2Ftiorg%2FFire%26droughtdoc

If one were considering only the more recent years it would appear that there was an upward trend; however any such trend is much less apparent when the data is considered over a longer period  There are a number of factors that might influence acres burned, including controlled (deliberate) burning to reduce wildfire fuel, increased housing density in wildland areas, and periods of drought
 

Based on an analysis of the ISO Property Claims Service (PCS)  wildfire losses from 1990 to 2012, on average less than 5% of the market total insured losses arise from commercial insurance  There has been no discernable trend in the share of PCS losses arising from commercial property over this period  This broader market data mirrors our own experience; Berkley companies have not seen significant losses in our own portfolio arising from wildfire events
We continue to monitor the composition of PCS losses, and our own losses as a share on PCS loss by peril, to ensure that should the current situation change we can take appropriate actions  At present, however, wildfire is not significant to us from an insured loss perspective

At Assurant, we believe that with the right approach, we can provide insurance for consumers currently in homes susceptible to extreme weather while maintaining sound actuarial standards Through our lender-placed insurance products, which also serve to protect lenders, consumers are provided the opportunity to secure coverage when other options may not be available Assurant is prepared and committed for the long term to remaining in Florida, for example, as well as other catastrophe-prone areas we service We take a long-term approach that is responsible to consumers, investors and society 

While we provide coverage for homeowners who lose coverage because of climate risk, we do not underwrite private flood policies in repetitive loss zones, as we believe it is important to follow responsible building practices We also educate consumers and regulators about the benefits of adopting climate-resilient improvements when constructing or repairing homes To incentivize these behaviors, where possible we offer discounts for those who have fortified their homes to mitigate the impacts of floods, hurricanes or other severe weather Most of our international home policies offer discounts for customers who build with more resilient materials and install wind mitigation features 

As one of the largest carriers of flood protection in the United States, we offer our customers a full suite of flood protection, including through the National Flood Insurance Program, which is reinsured, and through voluntary flood protection products that we underwrite To responsibly manage this risk, we employ flood specialistssuch as meteorologists, hydrologists and catastrophe modelersand leverage decades of experience to understand the intricacies of flood risk These underwriting practices and research investments support our long-term commitment to consumers who may be impacted by floods 
We continue to innovate new products to better serve our flood customers in the United States For example, we introduced a flood coverage enhancement called FlexCash, after observing that many consumers struggle with unexpected expenses before a claim payout arrives FlexCash provides an immediate fixed payout up to $10,000 after a flood event is verified using photographs This payment can help ease cash flow constraints that arise while we process a claim More than 70 percent of our voluntary flood polices include FlexCash In 2018, we also began offering limited flood coverage for renters Through the Federal Emergency Management Agencys Community Ratings System, we can discount flood insurance rates if the customer lives in a community that is taking action to mitigate long-term risks 

We also offer index-based insurance in certain geographies susceptible to climate change to protect consumers who are indirectly affected by extreme weather events Index-based insurance provides coverage to businesses that are indirectly impacted by climate change, such as a business owner whose surrounding neighborhood is damaged due to a natural disaster 

To help determine the protection solutions that best support our customers, consumers and the communities in which we operate, we engage with policy makers, government agencies and insurance regulators We work with regulators and state insurance departments to advocate for fair legislation that benefits our clients and end-consumers needs Through this dialogue, we develop new or improved products aligned with public policy interests

Truck Insurance Exchange," Direct impacts such as increased frequency and severity of precipitation events, droughts and wildfire are among the multiplicity of potential conditions that could impact ultimate loss events for insureds Some geographical areas in the US could be prone to more severe weather caused by climate change, however, the climate risk is not isolated in any one geographical location For example, analyses by major reinsurance and modeling companies are forecasting more flooding in the Midwest and the South, more severe convective storms in the Midwest, stronger hurricanes along the Gulf and the Atlantic zones, and more frequent wildfires in the West The risk of these events and combinations of events could pose a financial strain on the organization
Improved resilience and customers risk management actions continue to be significant foci of Farmers The key risk areas are outlined below:

Underwriting and Exposure Management
Farmers has exposure to physical risks of climate change from insurance policies As outlined in the previous section, the physical risks impacting Farmers customers, as a result of climate change, may generate higher volatility in claims Additionally, the potential indirect physical and public health impact, such as increased frequency of widespread disease events and localized food and water shortages, may also affect many areas of property and casualty insurance Such physical risks have both obvious and subtle consequences for insurers These vulnerabilities, risks and consequences are considered as an integrated part of the underwriting process in a manner appropriate given the tenor of the insurance instrument and the manifestation of variability, risk management vulnerability reductions and impacts

Regulatory
Regulatory risks, which encompass insurance regulatory obligations, emissions caps, base load management requirements and building code requirements, could impact the insurance business Regulation can have the unintended consequence of masking risk based price signals and could cause stakeholders to increase climate related risk  rather than manage and reduce such risks For example, subsidizing property insurance premiums or flood insurance premiums, or providing insurance or agreements to re-build in regularly eroded coastal locations or high risk fire areas could cause increase of building in such locations in a manner economically inconsistent with the physical risks presented by climate change Regulatory actions that restrict a company from making needed changes to its pricing, hazard management, or prompt litigation, which could put a financial strain on the organization

Regulatory uncertainty and regulation that is not economically well-grounded can create additional risk for both insurers and society Even where public policies are well grounded in sound economic policy, multi-state and nationally active insurers will likely be required to address potentially disparate and conflicting climate policies and rules, and bear the associated costs

Unless the results of interplay are completely and accurately analyzed in the development of such policy, true economic cost of new legislation that results in a disproportionate allocation of costs of climate related risks could pose potential unintended negative consequences for the industry These generally complex issues involving the interplay of new requirements within existing legal structures create unique risks - results of the same public policy will likely be different when applied in different jurisdictions Additionally, competing requirements could mean that compliance in one jurisdiction may not satisfy other jurisdictions, thus creating duplicative or additive expenditures in the development of adaptive risk management solutions without demonstrable economic or social benefit

Legal
As the insurance industry faces regulatory risk, they face legal risk as well Climate-related legislation that is not well-crafted may create incentives for lawsuits in some jurisdictions Even in the absence of new laws, there have already been and may continue to be attempts to use existing laws to bring more climate change-related litigation against sovereign entities and companies in particular sectors

Operational
With respect to an insurers own operations and physical facilities, more extreme weather events can impact one or more of our locations Having thorough business impact analyses, robust business continuity plans and crisis management plans are necessary to be able continue to serve our customers and agents without interruption Our footprint includes many major US locations (large locations in AZ, CA, OK, TX, MI and WA) as one way to diversify our physical risks For example, climate change (severe drought) may drive people/employees away from California, which could be damaging to a Southern California based company

Additionally, regulatory initiatives relating to emissions limits, transportation, water and energy use could impact office planning, employee commuting patterns and general resource usage Within Farmers, activities to help respond to these trends have begun, including telecommuting; meetings held via phone, video and webinar; recycling and other environmentally-friendly practices These risk management measures have come into play during the COVID-19 pandemic, as 98% of our employees are currently working from home on a full time basis

"Arcadian Health Plan, Inc.","  If this were to happen, it could lead to increased incidences of chronic illnesses and in the type of clinical services Humana will need to offer its members For example, ""The Impacts of Climate Change on Human Health in the United States: A Scientific Assessment"" published by the US Global Change Research Program notes that climate change is already resulting in significant public health impacts which will continue to worsen if greenhouse gas emissions are not addressed

If Humana did not prepare for changes in physical climate, it is possible that Humana could suffer a loss in market share due to lack of readiness as well as increased operational costs associated with more health-related claims being filed  It is difficult to assess the financial impacts of these risks given the complexity of climate change and population health, however we do not currently anticipate substantial bottom line impacts

Climate change risks may also affect Humanas premium pricing, and therefore projected revenues associated with our services  Pricing and revenues are sensitive to several factors that may be impacted by climate change, including catastrophes or extreme weather events including public health epidemics or severe weather (eg hurricanes)  We continually review estimates of future payments relating to benefit claims costs for services incurred and make necessary adjustments to our reserves, including premium deficiency reserves where appropriate However, these estimates involve extensive judgment, and have considerable inherent variability that is sensitive to claim payment patterns and medical cost trends Senior level management will review pertinent information and have the ultimate authority to recommend changes in services offered and cost structures related to shifts in claims filed, or other company procedures in order to reduce impacts from these changes in customer claims and health trends related to changes in climate  The results of our partner dialogues and regional trending will inform future decisions around services offered to mitigate these impacts




Risks driven by changes in regulation

The financial risks resulting from an increase in operational and capital costs due to climate change-related regulations are considered to have a low magnitude of impact because energy expenditures represent less than 01% of Humanas total operating budget Though operating expense increases due to energy taxes and regulations would have a material impact on budgetary costs, the overall operational cost impact for the portfolio would be minimal

Humana's Workplace Solutions team continuously evaluates short term and long term regulatory risks around energy and carbon A combination of forecasted energy costs due to general commodity price pressures, taxes and regulations or other impact is evaluated by the team to manage evolving financial exposure to energy prices In order to curb projected increases, the team works to budget for cost and environmental impact mitigation efforts such as energy efficiency projects to manage this risk This resulted in the formulation of an aggressive energy and carbon reduction target for the portfolio in efforts to manage operating costs and reduce Humana's environmental impacts

Risks driven by changes in physical climate parameters 

Increases in average temperature could result in more cooling degree days for Humana's data centers which could increase cooling loads at these and other locations

Any rise in average temperature that results in more cooling degree days throughout the year could increase cooling costs at Humana facilities, and in particular the company's data centers  Based on peer-reviewed research published in 2014, Humana has estimated the cost implications of rising data center energy consumption due to an increase in cooling degree days The potential aggregate estimated cost increase from 2015-2030 is $668,000, which is less than 01% of Humanas $7,381 million operating costs in 2019

Humana has worked with its equipment partners, done extensive modelling of air flow and cooling loads, and is implementing optimization strategies to minimize the cost of cooling and reduce the temperature differential required, while maintaining the reliability and performance of its data center equipment  For example, our IT and Facilities Management teams collaborated to install new building management systems (BMS) at the data centers These systems provide visibility into energy efficiency opportunities such as upgrades to lithium batteries and the addition of smart tiles to enhance the BMS system by monitoring air flows not just at the cabinet level, but also at the overall level We have installed the Tridium system in the Louisville Data Center and are strategically allocating capital funds to pursue projects at the Simpsonville Data Center

While Humana does not have a direct cost associated with managing cooling degree days, past and ongoing investment in data center energy efficiency mitigates the risk by reducing overall energy consumption For example, Humana continues to use modeling software and tools purchased prior to the reporting period to optimize air flow and cooling needs In 2018, the hardware for the Tridium BMS system cost $25,000, while in 2019, the installation of two HVAC upgrade projects at our Louisville and Simpsonville Data Center locations cost $910,000; funding came from the HUM Workplace Solutions Facilities Management team capital budget and the Facilities Management vendor managed the work

Significant weather events could also negatively impact our business by disrupting regular operations and limiting accessibility for our associates as well as our members Our Florida, Puerto Rico, and Texas operations in particular are located in areas that often experience severe storms As our data centers have disaster recovery methods in place to manage for risks unrelated to climate change, the estimated financial implications of this type of service disruption are considered to be low We relocated our recovery systems to Kentucky as a direct result of the lessons learned from Hurricane Maria, supporting our efforts to mitigate against hurricanes and other weather events, for which the financial implications are difficult to assess

To decrease the potential of business interruption due to a significant weather event, Humana's data centers maintain two separate power inputs, from different grids The centers also maintain a robust generator system that can provide power for 3-5 days before requiring re-fueling, while fuel service is contracted for a priority refill if requested Dual cooling systems are also in place Data center exterior walls were built to exceed ""tornado-level"" winds of over 100 mph, and both data centers are built on land not susceptible to flooding Humana maintains a secondary data center to support disaster recovery of technical systems In addition to our facility-specific management methods, Humana also has a robust work at home program, allowing staff to work remotely should there be an instance of reduced accessibility/pandemic or other issue A dedicated tool to track events is used to manage our response and communications, providing us with a readily available resource to understand any lessons learned

The management methods described, including the data center specifications, our Business Continuity Program, and our work at home program, and are considered to be routine operations for Humana to manage for several risks and opportunities in addition to the potential effects of climate change

Carolina Casualty Insurance Company,"  More details on the computer modeling are included in question 8  
In addition the ERM team regularly reviews pertinent scientific literature to ensure it understands current thinking on how climate change is impacting the perils that could currently or in future give rise to losses  
While it is clear that there are significant upwards trends in both economic and insured losses arising from natural catastrophes, if one normalizes the losses for changes in exposures and for societal changes these upwards trends largely disappear  For example there is no upward trend in the incidence or the intensity of the actual perils for tropical cyclone (hurricane, typhoon), tornado, flood or drought  To illustrate this point, the chart below show that over the period 1990 to 2012, global catastrophe economic losses have actually decreased as a percentage of GDP
http://rogerpielkejrblogspotcom/2013/03/graph-of-day-global-disasters-and-gdphtml
Similar results are seen for region-specific weather related losses normalized for exposure and societal changes using a number of different methodologies, for example population and wealth per head of population or number of housing units and wealth per household  Essentially there is a significant increase in both the number and the values of buildings and contents, oftentimes in areas that are particularly prone to weather-related catastrophes such as Gulf and Florida coastal areas 
We investigate trends in weather related losses by peril, as we recognize that the dominance of wind-related losses may disguise trends in other perils  This note is focused on North America, but similar results have been seen in a wide range of studies

Hurricane
Only a small proportion of hurricanes forming in the Atlantic Basin actually make landfall in the USA  Taking observations from 1880 onwards, there is actually a slight downward trend in the number of landfalling tropical storms and hurricanes  
The paper Tropical cyclones and climate change, authored by Thomas R Knutson, John L McBride, Johnny Chan, Kerry Emanuel, Greg Holland, Chris Landsea, Isaac Held, James P Kossin, A K Srivastava and Masato Sugi and published in Nature Geoscience in February 2010 suggests that globally we might expect to see an increase in tropical cyclones intensity of between 2% and 11% by 2100, and a decrease in landfalling frequency of between 6% and 34%  
Tornado
Tornado data is available as far back as 1950; however the older years understate the number of the least damaging EF-0 tornadoes  The introduction of Dopplar radar combined with increasing population and greater ease of recording and reporting events via cell phones and other mobile devises have greatly increased the number of EF-0 tornadoes reported  However, the number of tornadoes for categories EF-1 to EF-5 show no trend over the period from 1950 onwards losses, nor is there any trend in the proportion in each category EF-1 to EF0-5   Additionally, tornado losses show no trend once they have been normalized for exposure and societal changes

Flood
From a risk management perspective coastal flooding due to tropical cyclones is considered within our hurricane risk assessment  However we also consider riverine flood and groundwater flood   If one considers flood losses excluding storm surge associated with hurricanes (and post-tropical cyclones line Sandy), then flood losses are actually a decreasing proportion of the US GDP
Measures such as the annual mean US runoff and the percentage of streamages above bankful streamflow show no upward trend  Flood losses taken from National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA): http://wwwnwsnoaagov/hic/:
Drought
Within the past century, the most significant drought event was the dust bowl of the 1930s  During the last century, it is apparent that the El Nino / Southern Oscillation (ENSO) has a significant impact on the USA rainfall / drought conditions, but there is no evidence of any long-term change related to climate   
National Percent Area Severely to Extremely Dry:  data from National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, US National Percent Area Severely to Extremely Dry and Severely to Extremely Wet, wwwncdcnoaagov/oa/climate/research/2003/dec/uspctarea-wetdrytxt
When investigating the potential impact of climate change it is beneficial to obtain data for a longer period  NOAA has results from paleoclimatology studies that provide information on drought in North America spanning centuries   In the late 16th century there was a drought significantly more severe than anything subsequently experienced in the USA  These studies also indicate that droughts similar to the 1950s, in terms of duration and spatial extent, occurred once or twice a century for the past three centuries (for example, during the 1860s, 1820s, 1730s)
From an insurance perspective, the business line that might be most significantly and directly impacted by drought is crop insurance  Berkley insurance companies do not currently offer this coverage
Wildfire
The chart below shows acres burned per year from 1931 to 2003  It considers only protected land; if we consider all acres burned there is a very material decreasing trend   http://viewofficeappslivecom/op/viewaspx?src=http%3A%2F%2Ftiorg%2FFire%26droughtdoc

If one were considering only the more recent years it would appear that there was an upward trend; however any such trend is much less apparent when the data is considered over a longer period  There are a number of factors that might influence acres burned, including controlled (deliberate) burning to reduce wildfire fuel, increased housing density in wildland areas, and periods of drought
Based on an analysis of the ISO Property Claims Service (PCS)  wildfire losses from 1990 to 2012, on average less than 5% of the market total insured losses arise from commercial insurance  There has been no discernable trend in the share of PCS losses arising from commercial property over this period  This broader market data mirrors our own experience; Berkley companies have not seen significant losses in our own portfolio arising from wildfire events
We continue to monitor the composition of PCS losses, and our own losses as a share on PCS loss by peril, to ensure that should the current situation change we can take appropriate actions  At present, however, wildfire is not significant to us from an insured loss perspective

Allstate has a dedicated team of 15 employees who have accountability for monitoring and reporting on Allstate's exposure to catastrophes, as well as closely following ongoing scientific and hurricane modeling research through regular discussions with premiere catastrophe modelers The prevailing scientific thought about how climate change might be expected to impact the frequency and severity of future hurricanes is examined

While these actions can mitigate potential risks related to catastrophe exposure, the timing of catastrophes is largely unpredictable

Energy efficiency and greenhouse gas emissions reductions goals are the most important components of the short-term strategy to address climate change  For this approach, short-term is defined as less than 3 years  Working toward these goals influences our operational practices by focusing our team on energy efficient facilities operations, and has begun to influence the way we interact with our supply chain It has spurred direct investment in resources, both financial and personnel, to focus on climate change mitigation within our owned and leased facilities These investments have enabled Humana to implement projects such as HVAC upgrades, lighting, the installation of vending misers, and other building upgrades to ensure that energy is being used as efficiently as possible at Humana's facilities  all steps toward our reduction targets We have already started implementing workspace optimization efforts, which will increase the density of the workspace, while also decreasing vacancy in buildings For example, facilities consolidation in Cincinnati enabled us to reduce our facility space needs by 72,000 square feet and therefore reduced energy usage and greenhouse gas emissions 

On the whole, energy use reduction and greenhouse gas emissions reduction efforts not only drive progress toward our sustainability goals, but also illustrate to our employees and customers our commitment to reduce GHG emissions and operate as efficiently as possible Employee engagement efforts include a continuing focus on increasing work from home with the understanding that this strategy will have a significant impact on Scope 3 emissions, while providing our workforce greater flexibility and reducing operational demands of our facilities, thus having an overall positive impact on Humana's footprint In 2014, approximately 25 percent of Humanas 57,000 employees worked from home

In addition, Humana has coordinated with suppliers across their businesses to better understand ways that suppliers can partner with Humana to drive collective impact in the areas of sustainability and efficiency The initial focus of these initiatives has centered on Humanas efforts to reduce waste generation and waste taken to landfills throughout the companys supply chain  These efforts will have upstream and downstream impacts on Humanas operations with respect to the embodied energy and carbon of raw materials consumed, as well as the emissions and energy related with their disposal, be it by landfill or beneficial reuse or recycling

Our long-term strategy (generally considered to be 5-10 years) is impacted by potential consequences of climate change such as regulation, natural resource scarcity, facility operational costs and human health impacts Our CSR Stewards committee works with Workplace Solutions leaders to review short- and long-term trends and impacts associated with sustainability HR leaders refine our business strategy accordingly For example, Humana's portfolio includes both owned and leased assets Many of our facility investments are on a long-term basis (up to 10 years), whether these are leased or owned properties Humana has developed a sustainable real estate approach to ensure that investments in these facilities take into consideration the long-term impacts of building characteristics on climate change and overall environmental impact, employee wellness, and operational costs

Agri General Insurance  Company," Climate change is contributing to higher sea surface temperatures, rising sea levels and an increasing trend in extreme weather events, including floods, droughts, winter storms, heat waves, wildfires and hurricane intensity These weather events are colliding with the realities of urbanization  the growing exposures from the concentration of people and values created by the longterm shift from rural to urban living, including suburban sprawl  and so many located near water and wilderness because thats where people want to live Add to that government social policies that insulate people and society from the true costs of their decisions Hurricanes Florence, Michael and Harvey were significant events causing record flooding in the US Meanwhile, 2018 was the deadliest and most destructive wildfire season on record in California following 17s recordsetting wildfires Given the longterm threat and the shortterm nature of politics, the failure of policymakers to address climate change, including these issues and the costs of living in or near highrisk areas, is an existential threat As an underwriting company, our job is to understand, structure and assume climate changerelated risk for a fair price, and only do so to the extent of our balance sheet wherewithal and our ability to spread the risk to thirdparty capital Our approach to underwriting is factbased and relies on both our own experience and scientific expertise, and that of the expert network we engage outside our organization Climate risk is complex and requires a deep and evolving understanding of the physical processes causing weather extremes These tools are improving and are providing better insights to aid in how we think about these perils, but much remains unknown For example, what were traditionally nonmodeled risks can now be better analyzed, but flood models, for instance, are more advanced than those for wildfire, which remain relatively crude We also recognize that no matter how good, there is still much basis risk in our conclusions However, keep in mind that natural catastrophes are a shorttail risk, so losses are understood relatively quickly, and we can in most cases react to what we observe

Climate change is integrated into Chubbs strategies: the business (related financial risks and opportunities); operations (steps taken to reduce Chubbs GHG emission and ensure continuity of operations); and philanthropy (support of programs that further environmental stewardship)

The most important business strategy components influenced by climate change are changing hazards and opportunities Chubb uses internal and external data together with sophisticated analytical, catastrophe loss and risk modeling techniques to ensure an appropriate understanding of risk, including diversification and correlation effects, across different product lines and territories We recognize that climate changes and weather patterns are integral to our underwriting process and we continually adjust our process to address these changes This approach is intended to help ensure that losses are contained within our risk tolerance and appetite for individual product lines, businesses and Chubb as a whole Chubb has adjusted the pricing of some insurance lines, such as catastrophe-exposed property insurance and reinsurance, to reflect the high number and severity of natural catastrophes in recent years Because we are a global company, we consider all territories globally as potentially affected by climate risk

Our strategy has also been influenced indirectly, as Chubb provides clients with insurance and reinsurance protection from the impact of natural catastrophes, including weather events that may be more frequent or severe due to climate change Business lines that may be impacted include energy, marine, property and crop insurance coverage However, the same risks also present opportunities For example, as a leading provider of insurance for Clean Tech companies through their start-up, research and development, pilot projects and commercialization, Chubb supports the innovation and growth of businesses that help avoid emissions from fossil fuels Further, by combining the product and risk management expertise of its Construction, Energy and Marine industry groups, Chubb addresses perils that occur in the construction and operation of a renewable energy project

Chubb has also gained business opportunities related to the regulatory aspects of climate change Chubbs risk appetite, expertise and financial strength enable the company to assume a leadership position in insuring the developing areas of regulated GHG emissions, enhancements to existing products or entirely new product lines required by the potential for increased regulation of greenhouse gases globally, as well as emerging related exposures, such as directors & officers and professional liability As regulation and awareness increase, these coverages are expected to grow in demand

Additionally, as part of its underwriting process, Chubb regularly applies exclusions, which depend on the specific conditions and circumstances of the risk being evaluated Those exclusions may reflect climate-related considerations For example, Chubb is among the worlds largest global underwriters of environmental liabilities and pollution risks However, Chubbs underwriting in this business restricts participation in certain industries, including mining and reclamation operations, oil refining, pipeline and distribution operations and chemical manufacturing and distribution 

Chubbs strategy includes reducing GHG emissions from its own operations In 2019, Chubb set a companywide goal to reduce our global greenhouse emissions by 20% on an absolute basis by 2025 and 40% by 2035 and achieved the first of those two goals by year-end 2019 Both goals use 2016 emissions levels as the baseline Chubbs goals are aligned with the 2-degree Celsius target outlined in the Paris Climate Agreement, as well as the science-based standards methodology of the United Nations Environment Program

As a result of the culmination of years of energy-savings improvements, Chubbs office in Philadelphia earned LEED Silver certification in 2009 Over the next five years, Chubb increased energy efficient lighting (raising the Energy Star score from 72 to an 84), supported alternative commuting and implemented other green building initiatives at the location As a result, in 2020, the Philadelphia building earned LEED Platinum recertification Our Bermuda office was also re-certified LEED Platinum in 2019 Our Whitehouse Station twin buildings were certified LEED Gold in 2020

In the current reporting year, substantial business decisions influenced by climate change include Chubbs internal operations Initiatives to reduce workstation size and consolidate office space have resulted in a significant reduction in space per employee Chubb also invested in and implemented energy audits and efficiency improvements within our owned and long-term leased spaces Recent energy efficiency upgrades within three of our offices  enabled Chubb to reduce GHG emissions Further projects are underway

Chubbs philanthropy prioritizes environmental programs Through the Conservation Funds Chubb Land Legacy Fund, Chubb has provided over $1 million in funding since 2006 for the conservation of more than 345,000 acres of critical lands and water resources in the US The Chubb Charitable Foundation partnered with The Nature Conservatory to provide the continuation and expansion of coral reef restoration in the Mesoamerican Reef This effort resulted in transplanting 10,000 new coral colonies and establishing restoration sites The Foundation also funded a project with The Nature Conservancy to conduct a restoration and resilience project in Florida to demonstrate the flood protection benefits of nature-based solutions In 2020, the Chubb Charitable Foundation announced a $500,000 commitment to the Rainforest Trust, a global conservation organization that purchases and protects the most threatened tropical forests, saving endangered wildlife through partnerships and community engagement The protection of rainforests is one of the most effective ways to prevent the release of carbon that causes climate change The grant will support Rainforest Trusts Conservation Action Fund, which focuses on urgent conservation initiatives to protect critical habitats that would otherwise be used for development, agriculture or natural resource extraction For over 20 years, Chubb has supported the Bermuda National Trust with nearly $450,000 in grants to help preserve precious natural reserves and woodlands The Chubb Charitable Foundation also supports the environmental sustainability of cultural institutions Through a Foundation grant, the Philadelphia Museum of the American Revolution was recently awarded a LEED Gold certification for its commitment to energy conservation and environmental awareness Chubb additionally has an ongoing relationship with the American Forests Global ReLeaf®, wherein one tree is planted for each Environmental Insurance policy bound

ENCOURAGING ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSIBILITY
(GRI: 414-417; DJSI: 252, FTSE4Good)
As a global company MAPFREs environmental commitment is also focused on promoting environmental responsibility among employees, suppliers, customers and business managers, public and private associations and organisations and other stakeholders connected to MAPFREs activity, involving them in the achievement of goals, developing awareness actions and good practices, contributing to the development and dissemination of scientific knowledge and participating in environmental forums
Public bodies and authorities
MAPFRE participates in the main sustainability forums, such as the United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative (UNEP FI) and the Global Compact It is also very active in other forums, such as the National Congress of the Environment (CONAMA) and participates in conferences and working groups related to the analysis and evaluation of environmental risks, climate change and greenhouse gases MAPFRE also participates in initiatives designed to raise the publics awareness of the challenges posed by sustainable development and the risks associated with climate change
An example of this has been the participation, for the fourth year, in Earth Hour, in which the MAPFRE companies in Brazil, Mexico, Puerto Rico, Argentina, Colombia and Spain have taken part In addition to participating in this initiative with the symbolic gesture of turning off the company's neon signs and its advertising billboard lights for one hour in 34 main buildings and 204 commercial offices, employees have been encouraged through the Corporate Portal to take part from their homes
The Group also backs global environmental programmes such as the Carbon Disclosure Project, of which MAPFRE is a signatory, and in whose 2012 ""Iberia 125"" report it has advanced 11 points to an 83 disclosure score, and a C-band performance score
A broad range of measures has been adopted in Brazil and Puerto Rico (the companies there are implementing the Corporate Environmental Strategic Plan), with many more planned in the short term in these two countries and the United States
Suppliers
As established by the Principles for Sustainable Insurance, Environmental Responsibility is propagated in the value chain MAPFRE contributes to its suppliers' environmental performance by establishing selection criteria that assess their environmental conduct, and by ensuring that environmental clauses feature systematically in contracts Environmental clauses in bidding specifications help to foster sustainability in suppliers, as do sustainability criteria in procurement specifications and in the matrices used for comparing tenders, with particular attention to large corporate supplies 
In addition, it issues guidelines to suppliers of businesses or services that impact the environment and operate in environmentally certified work centres with a view to informing them of best practice in their business lines
Compliance with these measures is audited by MAPFREs in-house audit department
Meanwhile, MAPFREs Environmental Services suppliers form part of a constant evaluation process that guarantees the continuity of their authorizations and their service capacity
 
Employees
(GRI: 414-417, FS4; DJSI: 252, FTSE4Good)
MAPFRE employees in Spain received 2,693 hours of environmental training in 2012 MAPFREs environmental commitment remains a core component of the corporate training that all employees follow In addition, MAPFREs environmental department takes part as a speaker in a range of environmental training courses given to third parties
During 2012, participation in the Car Sharing project, which encourages employees to share private vehicles for their everyday journey to work, was even easier thanks to direct access on the en Persona corporate portal
Employee participation has been essential in the Green Signature project carried out in 2012 to establish a corporate awareness message on printing emails, with a winner to be selected from the 594 creative proposals sent by MAPFRE employees from 29 countries
General information on MAPFREs Environmental and Energy Policy can be accessed in the Internal Website Employee Area A special section with information and precise indications on environmental management and energy saving has also been created in this space for application in certain work centres
MAPFREs environment portal received more than 400 visits in 2012, and includes an environmental suggestion box which registered 55 enquiries during the year
Any enquiry or suggestion regarding MAPFREs environmental record can be addressed to the following e-mail address  medioambiente@mapfrecom


MAPFRE has adhered to the Principles for Sustainable Insurance promoted by the United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative (UNEPFI) that were presented at Rio+20 Sustainable Development summit, held in Río de Janeiro (Brazil)
This initiative seeks to bring into business management, as a risk and an opportunity, environmental issues such as climate change, damage to biodiversity and ecosystem degradation, water management and pollution; social aspects related to financial inclusion, human rights, health risks arising from development and population aging, and issues related to corporate governance, regulatory compliance, ethical management, conflicts of interest and transparency These are referred to as the ESG factors
The Principles for Sustainable Insurance represent the first global framework for the world's insurance industry that takes account of the economic impact of such aspects on the business MAPFRE is one of the world's 30 leading insurers that form part of this initiative, which together have a total of $5 billion of assets and 100% of the world's premium volume

	The previously established, Penn Mutual Green Team is annually tasked to investigate opportunities and standardizing methods for reducing the environmental impact of our business operations  This included continuously improving our current recycling program to become more comprehensive and robust while also reducing our energy consumption Methods include using sustainable paper products, purchasing equipment with energy star ratings, and doing business with vendors who certify sustainability in disposal of equipment

	Reducing energy consumption by reducing greenhouse gases and expenses  With continually refining our Building Management System (BAS) which controls our HVAC (heating, ventilation, air conditioning) and lighting controls, we have reduced our electrical consumption for FY15/16 for an average of 302,833 kilowatt hours/ month Our Natural Gas consumption has decreased to an average of 1,118 CCF/ month Additionally, because of improvements to our chilled water loop system, our water usage for the HVAC system been reduced by 39,567 gallons/ year from 106,762 gallons/year that was needed in 2014 

	To further reduce energy consumption and expenses for optimizing interior heating and cooling, we have continued monitored critical weather and cooling data for outdoor conditions of temperature, humidity, wind chill/ heat index, wind speed/ direction and comparing/ recording these conditions against the HVAC cooling loop temperature needs and making the necessary adjustments Data is being recorded and monitored in 20 minute increments  24/7 The objective for this data collection is for optimizing the Building Automation System (BAS) to automatically adjust critical temperature set points of the heating/ cooling system

	All facilities flush valves were replaced with auto flush devices utilizing 15 GPF units which reduce water usage Additionally, all restroom faucets were replaced with automatic devices to reduce water consumption This has resulted in lowering the average monthly water average to 185,931 Gal/ Month

	Penn Mutual is in the final phase of renovating our corporate facility in Horsham Pa An integral part of this renovation plan was for the reduction for the amount of trash that would be sent to landfills By partnering with Revolution Recovery and the Paul Restall Company, starting in 2012 through 2016, we have been able to divert 8022% or 46677 tons of construction waste from landfills Items recycled included carpet, ceiling tiles, light bulbs and commingled metal, wood, plastics, drywall, fiberglass and salvages materials which is donated or sold to woodworkers, artists, homeowners and non pro-profits for reuse All used office furniture is donated to non-profits, startup companies or recycled

Swiss Re LIfe & Health America Inc,") as part of its risk management and underwriting process The company supplements this process with research into climate change and its economic impact The process is led by three units within Swiss Re, mentioned in question 2:

-   Sustainability & Political Risk Management coordinates Swiss Re's climate change engagement including our program of climate risk research 

-    Emerging Risk Management coordinates the identification, assessment, and monitoring of new or emerging risks, including climate-related risks They recently concluded an assessment of the company's potential exposure to losses arising from climate litigation, with a focus on the United States, and Swiss Re continues to monitor this issue on a quarterly basis Further climate related areas which have been assessed are heat waves, drought and wildfires

-    Swiss Res Catastrophe Perils unit includes experts in windstorm, tropical cyclone and floodingThis unit is responsible for the design and maintenance of the company's loss models and supports the assessment of climate related risks as part of the underwriting process for our insurance and reinsurance activities Guided by collaboration with leading scientific institutions and the latest scientific knowledge, the models are updated accordingly on a regular basis The company's risk and premium calculations are based on the probabilistic hazard models, which are based on historic events To ensure our models and pricing calculations remain accurate going forward in a changing climate, we have to make sure that we identify significant future trends in natural hazards, quantify their long term impact on insured losses and include findings into our risk models and underwriting processes 

The Sustainability & Political Risk Management and Catastrophe Perils units collaborate closely on our ongoing program of research devoted to enhance our understanding of climate related risk and to assess the economic impacts of climate change on our portfolio of business  When this research generates valuable quantitative data, it is integrated into the company's risk management processes  

Swiss Re has also implemented an internal platform in its property & casualty business units called ""SONAR"" This initiative is designed to systematically screen evolving risks and changes in the risk landscape SONAR is a structure for the exchange of observations associated with risk among different countries, cultures, and offices throughout the Swiss Re Group  SONAR thus helps to improve understanding of Swiss Re's future exposure by reducing the degree of uncertainty related to future risks, including climate change risks

Swiss Re does not have a separate policy for the management of climate risks in relation to its investment activities Instead the investment process is focused on addressing a broader spectrum of environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues related to the investments See question 5 for more information 

Swiss Re has entered several strategic groups to exchange knowledge on risk issues including climate  For example, Swiss Re is a member of the Chief Risk Officers Forum Emerging Risk Initiative, which strives to present the insurance industry's shared position on emerging risks, and the company is a partner of the Global Risk Network of the World Economic Forum, contributing to its Global Risks Report  Swiss Re is also a founding member of ClimateWise, an insurance industry platform to assess climate change risk A former CEO of Swiss Re is Chairman of ClimateWise and the company also serves on the Management Board 

Swiss Re's research on the economics of climate adaptation (ECA) has a specific focus on the impact of climate change on local economies  The findings of ECA research are made available on a country-by-country basis on our website, in addition to our print publications, and we continue to update this as new findings become available  Swiss Re was closely involved in a new project incorporating the ECA approach working together with New York City See (chapter 2):

Farmers Insurance Company of Washington,"  As a long-term investor focused on managing assets to liabilities, we believe that investors taking both financial and non-financial considerations into account when making investment decisions will be the most successful in the long term  Issues such as corporate governance, climate change, use of natural resources, health and safety, labor relations, and human rights can be important drivers of investment risk and reward

We believe that a pro-active integration of relevant Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) factors into the investment process alongside traditional financial metrics and state-of-the-art risk management practices could support our investment result  However, integration of such factors requires diligence, expertise and focus  We do not believe that simply dedicating specific investment portfolios to the latest climate branded product of the asset management industry creates sustainable value for our stakeholders and the environment

Our investments are primarily managed by third-party asset managers, and it is at this level that individual security selection decisions are made  These asset managers operate within agreed portfolio guidelines set by Farmers and take all aspects into account, both financial and non-financial, when managing Farmers individual portfolios to ensure maximum value creation 

As our core competency is selecting the right asset managers and evaluating them based on their superior investment processes, we have taken the following actions:

1)  For the procurement of new asset managers, we include questions related to the inclusion of ESG factors in the investment process into our request for proposal (RFP)
2)  We have implemented the capability to monitor ESG ratings provided by MSCI in our risk systems  This allows us to enter into a proactive dialogue with our asset managers about risk exposures to environmental factors",4

Humana regularly reviews the ongoing risks and opportunities related to energy and climate impacts, and other environmental sustainability topics of material nature to Humanas business and its stakeholders As part of the periodic ERM updates with the ERMC and the Audit Committee, Humana conducts an exercise to identify and assess its top enterprise risks, as well as other material and relevant enterprise risks, which may encompass climate change related risks and opportunities As part of this activity, the ERM team facilitates discussions with risk owners to review and assess these enterprise risks This exercise is intended to consider both conventional and emerging risks Once these assessments have been completed, the results are summarized and presented to the ERMC and the Audit Committee This process allows for various levels of management to review and provide feedback on the assessments of potential risk impacts, risk velocity, risk mitigation efforts, and risk management maturity

Financial scenario analyses are then conducted for identified risks to determine priority and significance in relation to other risks This list of risk factors is updated as appropriate during the year in quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, and includes, but is not limited to, pricing, operational, strategic, regulatory, and financial markets risks that may be impacted by climate change

National union Fire Insurance company of Pittsburgh. Pa," The majority of policies exposed to catastrophic events are one-year contracts allowing us to quickly adjust our exposure to catastrophic events if climate changes or other events increase the frequency or severity of catastrophes

AIG uses industry recognized models and other tools to evaluate catastrophic events and assess the probability and magnitude of such events  We use catastrophe models based on parameters and assumptions that are rigorously checked for credibility In 2013, we established the Independent Validation Group (IVG) as part of our comprehensive Model Risk Management, which is governed by the Operational Risk Committee and Board of Directors  IVG continues to perform critical reviews of results and documentation of end-to-end processes for model development, implementation, and use  IVG contributes to identifying potential catastrophe model limitations and assessing their possible impacts, thereby enabling prudent underwriting of traditional climate risks such as natural catastrophe covers, catastrophe bonds, and weather risk transfer solutions  AIG periodically monitors the exposure risks of our worldwide operations and adjusts the models accordingly
Climate change may increase both the frequency and severity of natural catastrophes  As such, AIG has performed sensitivity analyses to quantify the impact on potential losses which account for greater variances      

AIGs diversity and presence throughout the global market strengthens the companys ability to manage risks efficiently by limiting the economic impact of any single event and by contributing to a relatively stable overall risk profile

American Standard Insurance Company,"  Several enterprise risks are impacted by climate risk  Some of these are catastrophe, business interruption, capital adequacy, liquidity, underwriting, and reinsurer availability  The risk identification discussions identify emerging and evolving risks that may be components of the risk categories listed or new risks  ERM division personnel participate in several networking and professional organizations in order to ensure identification of risks on the horizon, within the insurance industry or across all industries  In 2013 it participated in several webinars, emerging risk surveys and meetings where climate risk was discussed

As part of risk quantification, American Family uses an economic capital model to evaluate these risks and ensure that sufficient capital exists to meet our obligations to our policyholders in the event of unlikely, extreme (or tail) event scenarios such as an investment or natural catastrophe event  
ERM monitors extreme catastrophe model events that are beyond what the organization has experienced in its history to ensure it understands the impacts to capital, claim handling, reinsurance and other resources from extreme events  The division also performs catastrophe stress scenario testing that considers weather related catastrophes that are more extreme than experienced historically

American Family leverages technology to assist customers in understanding their driving behavior so they can focus on being safe drivers  This is modeled in the mySafetyValet usage based insurance program that was rolled out in 2013

The Company's insurance operations are office-based and, consequently, do not produce significant emissions in comparison to, for example, industrial operations  The Company seeks to operate efficiently and to minimize waste, which contributes to reduced emissions

As previously reported, the Company transitioned many key business functions to paperless environments, and similar efforts continued in 2013 within secondary business functions  Also, the Company continues to consolidate data centers where and when possible across Markel North America  In 2013, 5 remote datacenters were consolidated into the datacenter located at the Company's headquarters The Companys goal is to reduce all North American data centers down to 2  While the Company has made significant progress in the prior year in virtualizing our server environment, some effort of desktop virtualization began in 2013   Virtualization is a process whereby applications are run in separate, isolated partitions (separate virtual machines) within a single server Widely used in datacenters, each virtual machine runs its own operating system and application and can be moved or copied from one server to another for load balancing or to expand processing capability Along with greater utilization of hardware, this ""live migration"" feature is one of the major benefits of using virtual servers

The Company's affiliated non-insurance operations tend to engage in light manufacturing or service businesses and are not significant producers of emissions

The combination of data center consolidation and virtualization of computing environments is also expected to significantly reduce power consumption in support of business activities",0

Managing climate risk is a priority in much of the Companys commercial property and casualty (P&C) insurance underwriting practice The Company considers the factors behind climate change and its impact when evaluating new business lines and product offerings The P&C businesses seek to reduce their exposure to catastrophes through individual risk selection, including minimizing coastal exposures that could be more directly affected by climate change Several of the Companys P&C products also include incentives for using environmentally sustainable construction materials to rebuild damaged property The Company provides services, training and educational information designed to help customers improve safety, remediate environmentally adverse events, reduce losses and operate more sustainably Whether is it limiting exposure to catastrophic risk, helping its insureds manage the risk of weathers uncertainty for their crops, or providing insureds coverage for cleaning up environmental contamination, the Company places management of environmental risk at the core of several of its key operations

The Companys investment policies do not include the consideration of the impact of climate change  However, investment decisions and risk management considerations guide the amount that may be invested in, or lent to, any one company or asset classification  The Company believes its investment policies, as reflected in its investment portfolio, provide sufficient diversification without specifically considering climate change

The First Liberty Insurance Corporation,"  The Company is a member of the Board of Directors of the Geneva Association, which has an ongoing global initiative to assess the potential impacts of climate change on the insurance industry and develop strategies to enable the industry to address these impacts  

Liberty Mutual is a member of the Insurance Institute for Business & Home Safety (IBHS)  The following text, prepared by IBHS, is a brief description of the Institute and some of its activities that relate to the issue of climate change

IBHS is a 501(c)(3) organization, wholly supported by the property (re)insurance industry, which conducts objective, scientific research to identify and promote effective actions that strengthen homes, businesses, and communities against natural disasters and other causes of loss IBHS does this by identifying and advocating improved property design, construction, retrofitting, maintenance, repair, and preparation practices  IBHS guidance for mitigating property losses is available directly to the public and to our members/policyholders, at wwwdisastersafetyorg, and through social media (eg, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, YouTube and Vimeo)

IBHS advocates the concept of going green and building strong recognizing that addressing climate change involves both reducing greenhouse gas emissions and adapting homes, businesses, and communities to severe weather that may result from climate change:

¿	As an insurance-supported organization, IBHS recognizes that climate change strategies must do more than build structures to be energy efficient  They must be built to modern fire protection standards to help resist fire and avoid the water/chemical deluge needed for fire suppression; they should be strong enough to avoid wind destruction and resulting relocation in landfills; and properties should be sited and elevated in a manner that protects against flooding and environmental degradation from landslides  All of these are part of going green
¿	IBHS also firmly believes that adaptation is critical, not only to reduce long-term property insurance losses, but to buttress individual and societal resilience  All of the property protection measures that IBHS advocates to strengthen structures against current weather threats will also reduce future losses caused by climate change events  And, the unprecedented scientific research conducted at the unique IBHS Research Center is critical to identification of new mitigation actions that may help protect against more severe weather events
¿	Additionally, research conducted by IBHS will help to make sure that green building enhancements do not inadvertently cause structures to be less disaster-resistant, or even worse, threaten the life safety of occupants or first respondersfor example, photovoltaic arrays that take flight or pose fire suppression challenges are the antithesis of building strong  



Engagement of policyholders is provided in several ways  The Company offers discounts to policyholders that have taken specific steps to reduce their susceptibility to extreme weather events through structural modifications to their properties  Policyholders are incentivized to reduce their CO2 emissions through products that cover structural modifications such as installed solar panels with full replacement guarantees, and discounts for hybrid vehicles  Other products and endorsements allow for replacement of existing mechanical equipment and appliances with upgraded high efficiency units in the event of a loss  The Company also has Loss Prevention units staffed by engineers and other technical experts who consult directly with commercial property owners and develop detailed plans for actions that can be taken to reduce the susceptibility of losses due to severe weather events

In 2019 Southern California Edison revised Time of Use (TOU) peak hour summer rates for business customers This resulted in a rate increase of approximately $32,000 for UnitedHealth Group Other California utilities, including San Diego Gas & Electric and Pacific Gas & Electric, have additional rate increases starting in 2020
 
UnitedHealth Groups environmental management team takes specific action to mitigate risk through participation in deregulated energy markets For example, the environmental management team analyzes the deregulated energy market in order to develop electricity and natural gas procurement strategies These strategies are implemented through energy supply contracts, which involve procuring energy outside of the regulated utility tariff In 2019, these energy supply contract opportunities resulted in an annual deregulated market savings and cost avoidance of $428,340 from purchasing energy at tariffs lower than the regulated utility tariff, which offset the increases in costs across regulated markets  

Inherent risks associated with increased severity of extreme weather events and natural disasters have a potential to impact our facilities and business operations With offices located throughout the US, we have operations in regions that are vulnerable to extreme weather events and natural disasters Over the past few years, both the frequency and intensity of natural disasters have increased In 2017, we saw the number of office closures due to severe weather more than double (compared to the prior 3 years), and we experienced significant financial impacts from extreme weather events (ie hurricanes Maria, Irma and Harvey) In 2018, operations were impacted by wildfires in Camp and Concow, California The Camp Fire was only 10 miles away from where our Chico, CA office is located Employees who experienced property damage resulting from the fire were permitted to leave work to take care of their personal needs Smoke particles from the Concow Fire entered our office in Rancho Cordova  Due to concerns about potential health issues due to poor air quality, charcoal filters were installed in the HVAC units In 2019, after ""red flag"" warning about the possibility of wildfires was declared in some areas of California, the electricity company PG&E began to shut down power to prevent wildfires igniting from trees that touch the electricity lines The past 3 years equated to over $2M in damages to our facilities  Note that the $2M is direct cost and does not include potential revenue and earnings impact (ie consequential) impacts)

UnitedHealth Group incorporates comprehensive energy and environmental management into its Enterprise Real Estate Services platform and collaborates with the Enterprise Resiliency and Response team which is responsible for monitoring and managing weather-related risks that have the potential to impact business operations  Using established processes and systems to avoid weather-related business interruption, we utilize a risk-based, comprehensive business continuity planning process, which includes risk scenario-based annual exercises and written contingency plans  Additionally, we have identified critical operational sites within our portfolio that are at highest risk of mission impact if taken out of service for an extended period, as well as most susceptible to utility outages and related impacts, and built in redundancies to handle weather related natural disasters  For example, we developed an investment strategy to deploy backup emergency systems as necessary at these operationally critical sites to mitigate the potential effects of extended power outages

Inherent risks associated with aging infrastructure to support the delivery of energy sources such as natural gas and electricity may have a potential impact on our business operations

UnitedHealth Groups headquarters and primary operations are in Minnesota The local utility, Xcel Energy, has seen increased costs to maintain aging transmission and power generation infrastructure In 2019, due to aging utility infrastructure in California, the utility company, PG&E, shut down power to prevent wildfires igniting from trees that touch the electricity lines As highlighted in the key findings of the Fourth National Climate Assessment Volume II Impacts, Risks, and Adaptation in the United States: Our Nations aging and deteriorating infrastructure is further stressed by increases in heavy precipitation events, coastal flooding, heat, wildfires, and other extreme events, as well as changes to average precipitation and temperature Without adaptation, climate change will continue to degrade infrastructure performance over the rest of the century, with the potential for cascading impacts that threaten our economy, national security, essential services, and health and well-being Without attention, risks associated with aging utility infrastructure compounded by increases in severe weather and natural disasters may result in a greater risk of longer and more frequent power interruptions which could significantly impact UnitedHealth Groups core operations

KAISER FOUND HLTH PLAN OF WA OPTIONS," SASB also noted that an increase in the frequency of extreme weather events has the potential to impact costs and liabilities by generating additional covered medical expenses and that the associated risks could lead to an increased cost of capital Higher incidence of disease could negatively affect both clinical and non-clinical staff availability, resulting in higher expenditures on sick leave and backfilling The financial implications of these health-related impacts are difficult to quantify Changes in physical climate may also affect the efficiency of our facility operations, including increased power and water consumption necessary to maintain the indoor environment of our hospitals and patient care buildings
According to the US Global Change Research Programs published 2016 scientific assessment of the impacts of climate change on human health in the United States:
Current and future climate impacts expose more people in more places to public health threats Already in the United States, we have observed climate-related increases in our exposure to elevated temperatures; more frequent, severe, or longer-lasting extreme events; degraded air quality; diseases transmitted through food, water, and disease vectors (such as ticks and mosquitoes); and stresses to our mental health and well¬being Almost all of these threats are expected to worsen with continued climate change Some of these health threats will occur over longer time periods, or at unprecedented times of the year; some people will be exposed to threats not previously experienced in their locations Overall, instances of potentially beneficial health impacts of climate change are limited in number and pertain to specific regions or populations For example, the reduction in cold-related deaths is projected to be smaller than the increase in heat-related deaths in most regions Every American is vulnerable to the health impacts associated with climate change Increased exposure to multiple health threats, together with changes in sensitivity and the ability to adapt to those threats, increases a persons vulnerability to climate-related health effects The impacts of climate change on human health interact with underlying health, demographic, and socioeconomic factors Through the combined influence of these factors, climate change exacerbates some existing health threats and creates new public health challenges While all Americans are at risk, some populations are disproportionately vulnerable, including those with low income, some communities of color, immigrant groups (including those with limited English proficiency), Indigenous peoples, children and pregnant women, older adults, vulnerable occupational groups, persons with disabilities, and persons with preexisting or chronic medical conditions
In the April 4, 2013 edition of the New England Journal of Medicine, McMichael identifies three categories of climate-change risks to health, along with their causal pathway:
1	Primary: Direct biologic consequences of heat waves, extreme weather events, and temperature-enhanced levels of urban air pollutants;
2	Secondary: Risks mediated by changes in biophysically and ecologically based processes and systems, particularly food yields, water flows, infectious-disease vectors, and (for zoonotic diseases) intermediate-host ecology; and
3	Tertiary: More diffuse effects (eg, mental health problems in failing farm communities, displaced groups, disadvantaged indigenous and minority ethnic groups); consequences of tension and conflict owing to climate changerelated declines in basic resources (water, food, timber, living space)
With regard to primary risks, climate change directly impacts the populations in all geographical areas that KP serves While all regions in which KP operates are at risk of illnesses and loss of life due to extreme temperatures, the specific risk exposures may vary For example, while the Northern and Southern California regions are particularly affected by droughts, wildfires and heat waves, the Mid-Atlantic States and Georgia are more prone to severe storms and storm surges Hawaii and the Pacific Northwest are relatively more exposed to coastal flooding as well as heat waves In general, global warming can aggravate the effects of pre-existing health conditions such as chronic respiratory disease and asthma, due to increases in air pollutants and aeroallergens There is evidence of declining air quality in cities since greater heat can also worsen air pollution such as ground-level ozone or smog According to the National Center for Health Statistics, overall current asthma prevalence among adults increased from 20012002 (71%) to 20132014 (92%) By weight status, prevalence increased among overweight adults but not among adults in the obese or normal weight categories 

With regard to secondary risks, climate-related disturbances in ecological systems, such as changes in the range of infective parasites, can increase the incidence of serious infectious diseases The tick that carries Lyme Disease is reported in 457% of US counties, up from 30% in 1998 Other secondary health effects of global warming include water- and food-borne diseases Warm temperatures also increase water pollution which harms human health In rural areas, increased food insecurity can occur due to geographical shifts in optimum growing conditions and decreases in crop yields; reduced water resources for agriculture and for human consumption; and loss of property such as cropland because of floods, droughts and a rise in sea level
With regard to tertiary risks, according to The Medical Society Consortium on Climate and Health: Many people exposed to the worst extreme weather events experience stress and serious mental health consequences including depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and increases in suicidal thoughts and behavior Such disasters are also associated with increases in alcohol or drug abuse Children may also experience prolonged separation from their parents Beyond the well-known risks specific disasters pose to our mental health, the physical, social, and economic stresses created by climate change all increase our risk of mental health problems

The risks associated with climate change are being factored into financial risk analysis of our portfolios The Audit, Finance, and Investment Committee is being informed of the composition of our portfolio and levels of investment in areas that may have an environmental impact Monitoring of the portfolio positions the committee to provide guidance to investment managers and help shape selections and influence future business practices to be more environmentally sustainable The company believes that this allows not only ability to provide for the planets future but can also help mitigate some risks associated with environmentally damaging practices, such as government fines, legislative risk, and reputational damage, which can lead to financial losses for their investors 

Our investment managers attempt to avoid utility companies that could have stranded assets due to their use of fossil fuels and look for those that focus on sustainability as a differentiator They also limit exposure to insurance-related entities, which tend to have the greatest correlation to climate change conditions Although climate change is impacting the industries noted, our investment managers do not shy away from companies in sectors that may have exposure to climate change or are negative to climate change if their valuations are attractive and can add value to a clients portfolio from an investment income and / or price return standpoint That said, any decision around valuations are tactical in nature and revolve around sound fundamental analysis that reduces downside risk

Please note that the Companies have approximately 20% of their total writings in Property and the remaining 80% of their total writings are for lines other than property; thus the business focus is on liability lines of insurance Additionally the Companies write primarily commercial lines risks rather than personal lines risks 

Perils considered when assessing the potential risks posed by climate change include:
	Hurricane and tropical storm
	Tornado
	Flood
	Drought
	Wildfire

Hurricane
North Atlantic hurricanes and tropical storms typically impact states between Texas and Maine  The Group identifies and models its hurricane risks in 23 states that could be affected by these perils, and on an annual basis has its exposures modeled in an alternative vendor model with a broader set of states

As noted in section 3, over the period from 1880 onwards there is a slight downward trend in the number of landfalling hurricanes  Some of the weather and climate conditions that make it easier for hurricanes to form in the Atlantic Basin also appear to impair the likelihood of landfall  For example, hurricanes that form further from land are less likely to maintain their structure long enough to make landfall as damaging events  In the long term the current consensus view is that there will be fewer hurricanes, but that these will be of greater intensity However the same science that provides this long term view also indicates it will be many decades before we see the these changes

The Group closely monitors the forecast numbers of tropical storms and hurricanes for each season, investigates all available vendor models, and tests alternative assumptions on the potential frequency and severity of such events

Each individual property location is assessed for catastrophe risk, with particular focus on these nearest the coast and / or near river estuaries

Tornado
As noted in section 3, over the period from 1950 onwards the number of tornados is not increasing  In older calendar years there was significant under-reporting of the weakest category of tornado (EF-0); if one considers all other tornado strengths there is no trend in the frequency of these events or in the number falling into each strength category EF-1 to EF-5

When tornado insured losses are normalized for changes in exposures (for example, the number and values of the buildings and contents, often in areas that were previously agricultural land), these too show no increasing trend

The Group models tornado losses in every state within the USA, and has also revalued the tornados reported by the ISO Property Claims Service (PCS) from 1950 onwards to allow for changes in exposure as an additional data source  

Flood
As noted in section 3, flood losses arising from river and surface water are decreasing as a percentage of GDP  
The majority of the property policies issued by the Group exclude losses covered by flood  In those policies that do cover flood, many have flood sublimits

Drought & Wildfire
Drought and wildfire are strongly connected  One study looking at data through to 2002 indicated that fully half the variability in wildfire (measured by acres burned) arises as a result of drought conditions
http://viewofficeappslivecom/op/viewaspx?src=http%3A%2F%2Ftiorg%2FFire%26droughtdoc

As noted in section 3, the current period of drought is not as severe as periods seen in the past  Furthermore, there was a drought in the latter part of the 16th century that was far more severe than any subsequent drought in North America

The Group does not write the two business lines that would be most significantly impacted by drought (crop multi-peril) or by wildfire (homeowners)  Consequently our losses arising from such events are minimal

Alterra America Insurance Company,"

The Company's insurance operations are office-based and, consequently, do not produce significant emissions in comparison to, for example, industrial operations The Company seeks to operate efficiently and to minimize waste, which contributes to reduced emissions 

In 2015, Markel successfully completed the consolidation of their Markel North American data centers into a primary and backup site  both are located in North America  Markel is in the final phase of migrating North American associates to virtualized desktops  Virtualization is a process whereby applications are run in separate, isolated partitions (separate virtual machines) within a single server Widely used in datacenters, each virtual machine runs its own operating system and application, and can be moved or copied from one server to another for load balancing or to expand processing capability Along with greater utilization of hardware, this ""live migration"" feature is one of the major benefits of using virtual servers

The Company's affiliated non-insurance operations tend to engage in light manufacturing or service businesses and are not significant producers of emissions

The combination of data center consolidation and virtualization of computing environments is also expected to significantly reduce power consumption in support of business activities

Combined Life Insurance of NY," However, through our Corporate Environmental Program, we are committed to measuring, recording and reducing our mark on the environment even further This global effort focuses on reducing the direct and indirect GHG emissions generated from heating, cooling and lighting our offices and from company owned or leased vehicles, as well as the reduction, reuse or recycling of resources  Since 2006, ACE has reduced overall GHG emissions 22% per employee  In 2007 ACE joined the voluntary US Environmental Protection Agency-sponsored Climate Leaders initiative and developed a comprehensive GHG Inventory Management and Reduction Program which included corporate-wide emissions reporting, the establishment of a reduction goal and a strategy for achieving the goal Using the Climate Leaders methodology, ACE set a GHG reduction goal of 8% per employee from 2006-2012 and this goal was achieved three years ahead of schedule Based on these achievements, ACE announced a new corporate-wide Greenhouse Gas reduction goal in 2014: a 10% reduction in emissions per employee from 2012 to 2020 In 2014, ACE reduced Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions by 47% per employee since 2012 The corporate GHG inventory program still actively uses the EPA Climate Leaders methodology While that program was discontinued in late 2011, it is based on the World Resources Institute and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WRI/WBCSD) GHG Protocol for data collection and analysis To achieve our GHG reduction goal, ACE will aggressively work to make reductions within the organization The majority of ACEs emissions  approximately 70%  result from electricity use (data centers, plug loads, lighting, etc) and stationary combustion (oil/natural gas) by our offices As a result, ACEs Corporate Environmental Program focuses primarily on reducing our energy consumption at the facility level  specifically, in our owned buildings and larger, long-term leased spaces In 2014, ACE voluntarily implemented several building efficiency projects at our owned facilities including installation of new HVAC equipment, LED lighting as well as Building Automation System (BAS) upgrades and installation Due to green building efforts, ACEs Philadelphia building has reduced energy consumption more than 20% since 2006 through the installation of new boilers, LED lighting, efficient ventilation equipment and variable speed drive HVAC equipment The building earned LEED Silver certification through the US Green Building Council in August 2009 and in November 2014 achieved Gold certification In July 2011, ACEs Bermuda office earned LEED Gold certification due in large part to re-lamping of office lights, applying a floating temperature set point and installing motion sensors and timers on office equipment These actions reduced electrical needs by approximately 500,000 kilowatt-hours (358 metric tons of CO2e) per year ACE furthered its commitment to reducing emissions by earning Energy Star designations for both the Wilmington, Del, and the Philadelphia, Pa, offices in 2015

In 2014, ACE created a targeted energy policy for its operations in Europe, a region that includes 19 countries The policy aims to reduce GHG emissions by establishing building energy benchmarking and pursuing short-term objectives that reduce energy consumption within the region As part of this policy, ACE has conducted an energy audit at the London, UK office, for example, and has identified GHG reduction opportunities that are currently being implemented 

Another approach to reducing our GHG emissions is through decreasing our overall real estate square footage by condensing office locations and increasing the efficiency of work spaces Applying new company standards for the number and size of office and cubicle spaces not only reduces total real estate per-person square footage, but allows more light into the space, which decreases electricity consumption ACE also manages its flight-related emissions by operating new, ultra-modern jet aircraft equipped with the latest engines, wings and avionic design technologies, making them leaders in their respective aircraft categories for efficient flying These advanced capabilities allow ACEs aircraft to operate at very high altitudes and consume less fuel These advanced aircraft also fly optimal routes, which have shorter distances between world destinations, saving fuel and ultimately the release of GHGs In addition, ACE reports its GHG emissions data and related activities to CDP (formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project), an independent, not-for-profit organization that gathers and scores primary corporate carbon emissions information for thousands of businesses around the world In 2014, ACEs 2013 submission to the CDP resulted in a disclosure score of 93 and a performance score of B

Associations play an instrumental role in disseminating the importance of sustainability and transparency to organizations worldwide By sharing guidance, best practices and information with their members, and even by engaging in the development of reporting rules, associations are helping make a difference to the sustainability performance of thousands of companies  Association members help the trade associations to identify innovative approaches they and their members could adopt to face the worlds current sustainability challenges From new ways of approaching income creation to protecting the worlds resources and educating the next generation of business leaders, 
associations can inspire their members to move the sustainability agenda forward Boards are increasingly being challenged on a range of sustainability related topics and the collaboration between trade organizations about the benefits of integrating sustainability into core business activities, as well as reporting on performance to the markets is an integral step in the process

	Organizations work with associations to reach all companies in the world and encourage them to be transparent about their sustainability performance By doing so, they can increase the value they offer their members, helping their organizations navigate todays sustainability challenges In addition, active associations can be at the forefront of CC legislation and the development process of reporting and sustainability integration

Unum leverages trade associations for sustainability best practices, staying abreast of the latest research, and methods to align our facilities to have a lesser impact on CC Because we are interested in minimizing climate change and continually evolving sustainable practices, we participate in various activities that may influence policy They are, but not limited to, the following:
 Participation in association roundtable discussions
 Partnership/networking with other organizations and leaders to share knowledge and best practices
 Benchmarking analytics to ensure sustainability alignment with like organizations
 Research tools and resources to ensure we are knowledgeable on the latest CC research, products, services, and literature
 Educational sessions for continuous improvement in our knowledge and understanding of CC related topics
 Feedback regarding challenges, barriers, results, and opportunities to improve processes

The risks of climate change on Cambias health insurance operations relate primarily to any resulting increases in average morbidity rates Changes in morbidity risks are monitored through existing risk management practices and measured against pricing assumptions Cambia monitors risks and impairments to its investment portfolio on an ongoing basis  With respect to asset management we do not have a direct or exclusive risk assessment related to climate change We do regularly review both our liquidity, capital, and income needs of our investment portfolio as a part of a regular investment risk assessment and risk tolerance setting process, which considers a variety of potential risks and impacts It is, in fact, the unknown future costs, impacts, and needs which along with the effect of climate change risk, whether related to underwriting or other factors, represent another reason to maintain strong surplus levels to ensure ability to continue meeting the needs of our members

As part of the identification process, the Company continually evaluates industry commentary on emerging risks and monitors trends for known risks  In addition, the Company consults with subject matter experts and professionals in the industry to determine whether its risk program adequately addresses known and emerging risks  Once identified, the risk is evaluated to determine if the risk is present in the organization and, if so, what action could mitigate or reduce the impact on the organization  

For example, the Company has identified catastrophe risk as one of its top 5 risks  The Company mitigates the risk through the purchase of property catastrophe reinsurance and by managing its aggregate exposure from severe storm-exposed premium and policy counts  The tools used to make decisions in both of these areas are hurricane computer models  These models use the most recent climate science to project the frequency and severity of hurricanes  Additionally, the Company uses near-term hurricane frequency forecasts in its decision-making

ENCOURAGING ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSIBILITY
(GRI: 414-417; DJSI: 252, FTSE4Good)
As a global company MAPFREs environmental commitment is also focused on promoting environmental responsibility among employees, suppliers, customers and business managers, public and private associations and organisations and other stakeholders connected to MAPFREs activity, involving them in the achievement of goals, developing awareness actions and good practices, contributing to the development and dissemination of scientific knowledge and participating in environmental forums
Public bodies and authorities
MAPFRE participates in the main sustainability forums, such as the United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative (UNEP FI) and the Global Compact It is also very active in other forums, such as the National Congress of the Environment (CONAMA) and participates in conferences and working groups related to the analysis and evaluation of environmental risks, climate change and greenhouse gases MAPFRE also participates in initiatives designed to raise the publics awareness of the challenges posed by sustainable development and the risks associated with climate change
An example of this has been the participation, for the fourth year, in Earth Hour, in which the MAPFRE companies in Brazil, Mexico, Puerto Rico, Argentina, Colombia and Spain have taken part In addition to participating in this initiative with the symbolic gesture of turning off the company's neon signs and its advertising billboard lights for one hour in 34 main buildings and 204 commercial offices, employees have been encouraged through the Corporate Portal to take part from their homes
The Group also backs global environmental programmes such as the Carbon Disclosure Project, of which MAPFRE is a signatory, and in whose 2012 ""Iberia 125"" report it has advanced 11 points to an 83 disclosure score, and a C-band performance score
A broad range of measures has been adopted in Brazil and Puerto Rico (the companies there are implementing the Corporate Environmental Strategic Plan), with many more planned in the short term in these two countries and the United States
Suppliers
As established by the Principles for Sustainable Insurance, Environmental Responsibility is propagated in the value chain MAPFRE contributes to its suppliers' environmental performance by establishing selection criteria that assess their environmental conduct, and by ensuring that environmental clauses feature systematically in contracts Environmental clauses in bidding specifications help to foster sustainability in suppliers, as do sustainability criteria in procurement specifications and in the matrices used for comparing tenders, with particular attention to large corporate supplies 
In addition, it issues guidelines to suppliers of businesses or services that impact the environment and operate in environmentally certified work centres with a view to informing them of best practice in their business lines
Compliance with these measures is audited by MAPFREs in-house audit department
Meanwhile, MAPFREs Environmental Services suppliers form part of a constant evaluation process that guarantees the continuity of their authorizations and their service capacity
 
Employees
(GRI: 414-417, FS4; DJSI: 252, FTSE4Good)
MAPFRE employees in Spain received 2,693 hours of environmental training in 2012 MAPFREs environmental commitment remains a core component of the corporate training that all employees follow In addition, MAPFREs environmental department takes part as a speaker in a range of environmental training courses given to third parties
During 2012, participation in the Car Sharing project, which encourages employees to share private vehicles for their everyday journey to work, was even easier thanks to direct access on the en Persona corporate portal
Employee participation has been essential in the Green Signature project carried out in 2012 to establish a corporate awareness message on printing emails, with a winner to be selected from the 594 creative proposals sent by MAPFRE employees from 29 countries
General information on MAPFREs Environmental and Energy Policy can be accessed in the Internal Website Employee Area A special section with information and precise indications on environmental management and energy saving has also been created in this space for application in certain work centres
MAPFREs environment portal received more than 400 visits in 2012, and includes an environmental suggestion box which registered 55 enquiries during the year
Any enquiry or suggestion regarding MAPFREs environmental record can be addressed to the following e-mail address  medioambiente@mapfrecom


MAPFRE has adhered to the Principles for Sustainable Insurance promoted by the United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative (UNEPFI) that were presented at Rio+20 Sustainable Development summit, held in Río de Janeiro (Brazil)
This initiative seeks to bring into business management, as a risk and an opportunity, environmental issues such as climate change, damage to biodiversity and ecosystem degradation, water management and pollution; social aspects related to financial inclusion, human rights, health risks arising from development and population aging, and issues related to corporate governance, regulatory compliance, ethical management, conflicts of interest and transparency These are referred to as the ESG factors
The Principles for Sustainable Insurance represent the first global framework for the world's insurance industry that takes account of the economic impact of such aspects on the business MAPFRE is one of the world's 30 leading insurers that form part of this initiative, which together have a total of $5 billion of assets and 100% of the world's premium volume

Sentry considers the transition period from fossil fuel use to a renewable energy, green power structure when making investments This transition period could result in stranded assets or investments with little or no pay-off in the future According to several studies by highly regarded experts, including McKinsey and the United Nations, the transition period currently extends beyond 2040 and 2050 Sentry believes its holdings of bond investments of carbon fuel producers maturing past 2040 or 2050 to be limited and immaterial to its financial position

When purchasing municipal bonds of obligors near major rivers, waterways or the coast, Sentry uses modeling from NOAA to evaluate the risks of rising sea levels

Climate change issues and the resulting governmental policy impact are creating opportunities in Green Technology investments These investments are found in our Private Equity and Venture Capital portfolios, with investments in wind and solar power generation being the major category Sentry also makes investments in companies that focus on developing technology for the clean-up of pollutants that have been released in the environment 

Through its alternative investment portfolio, Sentry has significant exposure to various funds that invest in companies that may be considered to be environmentally conscious investments These include investments in fund partnerships where some of the underlying companies are focused on investments in solar, wind power, geothermal, and biofuel

Environmental Sustainability: As a leader in social responsibility, we are employing innovation and determination to move the sustainability needle We optimized our energy performance and reduced our energy consumption across the Aetna-owned portfolio of facilities in 2012 and 2013, excluding the Coventry Health Care properties we acquired last year We saved more than 178 million kilowatt hours across the enterprise from 2011 to 2013  a 156 percent reduction over 2 years

The lynchpin of this effort is our Sustainable Data Center and Technology initiative Recognized by the Computerworld Honors Program in 2013 for using information technology to promote positive social and economic change, our green data center project enables 20 percent greater operating efficiency  adding at least a decade of life to our data centers

We also continue to invest in renewable energy, virtually doubling our annual production of electricity in 2013 to 465,000 kwh with the addition of solar panels to a second Aetna-owned facility

Building on our foundational strengths, we will continue to help improve the quality of life for the American s and people across the globe for a more sustainable future

"Columbia Mutual Insurance Company, Inc.","  At the time of this response, management of catastrophe exposure remains the highest priority risks in the companys ERM program summarized in response to Question 2  As part of that program, risk owners take responsibility for carrying out the risk controls that have been identified to help monitor and manage risks related to changes in weather and climate  Some of these risk controls include:

o	The use of external catastrophe models and historical results to assess prospective catastrophic risk for pricing and exposure management purposes;  
o	Evaluating information generated internally or provided by our reinsurance partners to assess our overall exposure to various catastrophic risks
o	Consideration of property facultative placement and review of controls in place designed to monitor coastal and earthquake exposures
o	Careful evaluation of agency appointments in catastrophe prone areas  

These and other tools allow us to structure our reinsurance program to protect the company from major loss from these potential weather-related events  As the demand for reinsurance increases in the industry in general, the costs and terms associated with it favor the reinsurers

Based on information obtained through our ERM program, we have continued to minimize our concentrations of personal property lines of business as they are more prone to weather-related losses  Our ERM Risk Register is continually assessed, revised and updated to reflect the most current applicable risks, and the potential impacts of climate change related risks are regularly reassessed

United Farm Family Insurance Company,"

When considering individual investments as well as the aggregate amount of investment categories the Companies consider risks beyond the traditional investing frameworks of credit worthiness and growth potential A holistic approach to investment risk considers political, macroeconomic, environmental and potential correlations with other risks the Companies accept For example, climate risk is often associated with underwriting risks that the Companies manage with geographic concentration analysis and reinsurance A large loss may impact the Companies underwriting results, reinsurance collectability, the credit quality of a reinsurers bonds and the value of the reinsurers equity Similarly, societal initiatives to reduce carbon emission may impact private or municipally owned electric utilities as well as global demand for fossil fuels which may impact asset values

The potential for climate change risk impacting the portfolio is addressed holistically and not isolated to a particular investment type  Accordingly, all of the Companies risk monitoring beginning with asset allocation through individual asset purchase limits assists with monitoring each individual risk

The Companies also believe that the Efficient Markets Hypothesis, which holds that all known risks are discounted in the current price of an asset, adequately discounts risks such as climate change by the pricing mechanism inherent within capital markets  Risks such as climate change are discounted within the price of an individual asset

NATIONWIDE PROP & CAS INS CO,"

Nationwide primarily focuses its actions on reducing its energy consumption and environmental impact, but the company is also actively engaged in actions related to natural disasters, mitigation of losses and building code enforcement Ongoing company actions include forming strategic partnerships and supporting nongovernmental organizations; achieving formal certifications and designations from organizations assessing the environmental actions of companies; supporting research; formulating public policy decisions that drive our decision-making; providing education/communication to employees and customers to raise awareness; and creating incentives for customers to influence behavior

The insurance industry plays a unique and critical role in the disaster mitigation and recovery process, serving as a leader in promoting pre-disaster loss-prevention techniques, and standing shoulder to shoulder with the federal government and emergency responders to make victims whole after a catastrophe

Nationwide continues its efforts to urge the federal government and state legislatures to introduce and pass legislation that will provide incentives for consumers, home builders and contractors to build or reinforce homes and small businesses using Insurance Institute for Business & Home Safety (IBHS) construction and retrofit standards We were instrumental in working with Congress and the Federal Emergency Association in passing the Disaster Recovery Reform Act of 2018, a national strategy for investing in disaster mitigation as a means of addressing our nations increasing number of severe and costly weather events Nationwide continues to be a leader in within the BuildStrong Coalition, a group made up of firefighters, emergency responders, insurers, engineers, architects, contractors, and manufacturers, as well as consumer organizations, code specialists and others as they look to implement the DRRA Nationwide believes that action must be taken to make homes and businesses stronger and more resilient Incentives like building permit rebates, state-level tax incentives, and state and federal grants could lead to more resilient communities by offsetting some of the costs

North American Elite Insurance Company," We engage with policy makers at international and national levels, business leaders in the insurance industry and other sectors, multilateral organizations, NGOs, and others

Much of the work Swiss Re does at the policy-maker level around the globe on the climate change topic aims to encourage a better understanding of the need for action as well as how the insurance industry can contribute from the perspective of a provider of risk transfer, a risk manager and as an investor Swiss Re generally works to support actions to help move the debate in the right direction rather than giving support for specific pieces of legislation For example, in Europe, we have continued to raise awareness of the important role insurers play in mitigating climate risk through different interactions with policy makers This includes speaking at industry conferences (Insurance Europe and the ABI), presenting at the European Commissions DG Climate Actions working group on Climate Adaptation and engaging bilaterally with the European Commission and national governments In the US, we have maintained regular dialogue with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC), principally on climate change and natural catastrophes In Switzerland, we have provided a committee member to the OcCC (Organe consultatif sur les changements climatiques), an advisory body on climate change set up by the Swiss Federal Administration

The RE100 group, of which Swiss Re is a founding member, approaches policy-makers and regulators at the national and sub-national level to make renewable energy more available, focusing eg on countries such as China, India, Brazil and South Africa over the next three years

Swiss Re leads a regular dialogue with national and sub-national policy-makers through a dedicated unit, Global Partnerships Global Partnerships advises and develops business with governments and other public sector bodies and seeks opportunities in the microinsurance field 

In 2016, we helped to establish two significant insurance pilot programs against natural disaster risks in China Natural disasters occur frequently in China and are widely scattered They affect individuals, businesses and governments alike Up until recently, however, those at risk have largely ignored the potential financial impact of natural disasters when accounting for their financial and fiscal liabilities Moreover, they tend not to set aside any contingent capital to prepare for such liabilities For government bodies, in particular, this protection gap is highly significant as it could grow exponentially in coverage and scale in the future

When the Chinese State Council carried out a review of the insurance industry a few years ago, it identified this challenge and issued a mandate to formulate and promote natural catastrophe schemes 

In response, Swiss Re worked together with the Development Research Center of the State Council (wwwendrcgovcn/) to report on Parametric Insurance and Reform of Natural Disaster Relief Systems in China This was subsequently discussed with high-level officials and led to the development of two pilot programs in the provinces of Heilongjiang and Guangdong, which were successfully launched in 2016 Both offer protection of up to around USD 350 million, which makes them the largest commercial natural disaster insurance schemes in China to date  Both use parametric triggers, which means they can pay out quickly in the event of a disaster The first of the two programs involves the government of Heilongjiang Province and the Sunlight Agriculture Mutual Insurance Company of China It protects farmers in 28 poor rural counties of the province against the financial consequences of natural catastrophes, specifically floods, excessive rain, drought and low temperatures Combining a weather index product and a satellite-based parametric product, the program covers harm to lives and property as well as loss of income  As the program's sole reinsurer and technical adviser, we used advanced modelling techniques to design this innovative solution  the first of its kind In the second pilot, we act as sole reinsurer to protect ten prefectures of Guangdong Province against damage from tropical cyclones and excessive rainfall, in cooperation with local insurers, including the People's Insurance Company of China (PICC, wwwpicccom) This, too, is a parametric product, using rainfall and wind speed indices to allow for faster payouts Having quick access to emergency funding after a natural disaster is particularly important in Guangdong It is one of China's most important economic hubs and home to many global companies, but faces a severe natural disaster risk

In 2016, the Centre for Global Dialogue organized the Agricultural and Natural Catastrophe Insurance Forum to discuss the underlying challenges, assess possible solutions and share experiences Nearly 40 Chinese government officials and insurance professionals met with international experts to explore the feasibility of introducing parametric solutions across China, drawing on the learnings offered by the two pilot projects in Heilongjiang and Guangdong In addition, experts from Swiss Re and other organizations elaborated on the latest developments in flood risk management, catastrophe bonds, agricultural and aquaculture insurance, and public-private partnerships

Memberships of organizations such as The Climate Group allow for periodic dialogues on climate-related topics, (predominantly resilience and risk transfer themes) with regional, national and state governments which are also members In the area of resilience building, at the UN climate summit in September 2014, Swiss Re pledged its financial capacity as well as its expertise to help nations increase their climate resilience through the following commitment: ""By the year 2020, Swiss Re commits to having advised 50 sovereigns and sub-sovereigns on climate risk resilience, and to have offered them protection of USD 10bn against climate related risks""  We have agreed with the United Nations to report publicly on the progress we make on this commitment By the end of 2016, we had advised 26 sovereigns and sub-sovereigns on climate risk resilience and offered them a total of USD 39 billion in re/insurance protection

Reflecting governments growing concern over the implications of climate change, the Financial Stability Board (FSB) has established a Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures, or TCFD (wwwfsb-tcfdorg), in 2015 The FSB is an international body that monitors and makes recommendations about the global financial system, coordinating national financial authorities and international standard-setting bodies Starting from the premise that climate change creates physical, liability and transition risks, the TCFD aims to develop consistent and effective financial disclosures that will allow stakeholders to properly assess the climate risks faced by companies and to take appropriate action In 2016, TCFD published its Phase 1 report for public consultation After processing the inputs received from key stakeholders, it launched its Recommended disclosures in December 2016 Swiss Re was involved in the development of the recommendations on climate risk reporting, has been providing one of the Task Force's members since the TCFD's launch, and adopted the TCFD recommendations in December 2016 As a member of the Task Force, Swiss Re has been presenting the (draft) recommendations at various occasions to different stakeholders, including policymakers and industry associations (eg Swiss Sustainable Finance webinar, Swiss Insurance Association)
Swiss Re also works closely with organizations such as The Climate Group to influence the debate on climate change Throughout the year, Swiss Re has regularly contributed to platforms such as the World Economic Forum, B20, G20 and G7 to share our insights on key risks, and support the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) process

Garrison Property and Casualty Insurance," USAA uses an extensive suite of catastrophe models purchased from well-known and well-respected vendors The Catastrophe Risk Management unit has dedicated computing resources and trained personnel to run these models internally Catastrophe model results are refreshed and evaluated monthly to track the impact of exposure changes on projected losses (Average Annual Loss, Tail Value-At-Risk, and Probable Maximum Loss) An extensive refresh of model parameters, assumptions and input data is performed annually to shape underwriting and pricing guidelines in catastrophe-prone areas In addition to internally-run vendor models, external research is also used to validate and inform underwriting, pricing and business decisions related to these risks

¿	Internal Models

USAA uses state-of-the-art modeling software to measure hurricane, wildfire, winter storm and severe thunderstorm (including tornado) risk The selection of model parameters can produce a wide range of possible exceedance probability curves, so parameter estimation is calibrated with the purpose of any given model run For example, USAA uses a subset of historical years with higher than average sea surface temperatures that can be used to parameterize the computer model as a proxy for estimating hurricanes under global warming conditions 

¿	External Models, Research and Validation
In addition to the models maintained internally, USAA works closely with its reinsurance brokers to validate model parameters and results This allows us to improve quantification of the range of risks posed by natural catastrophes, including estimating future impact
USAA monitors scientific research on climate issues, including findings of the IPCC, the US Department of Defense, the National Climate Assessment of the US Global Research Program, the Actuaries Climate Index Research Project, and various actuarial and scientific journals This research shapes assessment of weather-related, regulatory and business operation risks, and informs model validation and parameterization

This assessment and research leads to more uncertainty in model results As a result of model uncertainty, USAA has set conservative capital requirements These conservative capital requirements drive our underwriting, pricing, and reinsurance-purchase decisions Growth in catastrophe-prone areas is managed in light of these risks, and USAA purchases enough reinsurance and holds enough capital to cover potential impacts of changing weather patterns USAA also realizes that it is insufficient to be prepared for only the types of catastrophes experienced in the past 100 years  Consequently, USAA performs annual stress tests to simulate the impact of extremely rare catastrophe losses on business operations, claims settlements, and overall financial strength USAA uses these stress tests to understand its strengths and weaknesses, so that we can adapt to new conditions and continue to provide excellent service and remain financially sound even if an unprecedented event happens

Farmers Insurance Company of Arizona,"  We expect the overall losses from the perils of Wildfire, Flood and Hurricane, which are sensitive to climate change, to increase for society as a whole, and the insurance industry in particular  Wildfire risk is of particular concern to us given our concentration in the western United States  In addition, Farmers faces climate-related regulatory and legal risks

Farmers manages its climate-related catastrophe risk through actuarially sound pricing, prudent risk eligibility guidelines, judicious use of reinsurance, and statistical modeling of enterprise capital under various stress scenarios Farmers uses both internal and external catastrophe models to make our best assessment of prospective catastrophe risk for pricing, risk selection, capital optimization and reinsurance purposes  We adjust the models based on our own experience, research and historical model performance Our capital modeling work generates outputs on a deterministic and probabilistic basis which we use to manage our enterprise view of risk The external models for the hurricane peril are fairly mature, and we have reasonable confidence that they provide a good foundation for estimating the hazard risk in the near-term scenarios Models for wildfire and non-hurricane weather perils are less mature and we therefore adjust the model results based on internal company data and informed judgment In 2019, we upgraded to a newly released version of an industry-leading Wildfire Model (from Applied Insurance Research), which increased our assumptions about both the frequency of Wildfire occurring, and the potential severity of larger fires While the modeling data and outputs continue to improve over time, there is still uncertainty around the outputs Regulatory and legal risks create additional uncertainty, as the various state regulators are not consistent about which models and model adjustments they will allow for use in pricing Farmers views this uncertainty as a reason to be cautious and conservative in our selection and pricing of risk, and our overall tolerance of catastrophe exposure

Homesite Insurance Company of New York,"  This includes offering mitigation discounts in some states to customers that make use of storm shutters or other construction features to reduce the risk of loss due to hurricane  In addition, Homesite posts informational articles on our website that outline methods home owners can adopt to increase the durability and safety of homes to natural perils  At the time of major weather events, most often hurricanes, Homesite will contact customers by e-mail and phone to warn of the event and provide safety tips for protecting life and property during the event

Homesite is a member of the Insurance Institute for Business and Home Safety (IBHS)  The following text, prepared by IBHS, is a brief description of the Institute and some of its activities that relate to the issue of climate change
IBHS is a 501(c)(3) organization, wholly supported by the property (re)insurance industry, which conducts objective, scientific research to identify and promote effective actions that strengthen homes, businesses and communities against natural disasters and other causes of loss IBHS does this by identifying and advocating improved property design, construction, retrofitting, maintenance, repair and preparation practices  IBHS guidance for mitigating property losses is available directly to the public and to our members/policyholders, at wwwdisastersafetyorg, and through social media (eg, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, YouTube and Vimeo)
IBHS advocates the concept of going green and building strong recognizing that addressing climate change involves reducing greenhouse gas emissions and adapting homes, businesses, and communities to severe weather that may result from climate change:
   	As an insurance-supported organization, IBHS recognizes that climate change strategies must do more than build structures to be energy efficient  They must be built to modern fire protection standards to help resist fire and avoid the water/chemical deluge needed for fire suppression; they should be strong enough to avoid wind destruction and resulting relocation in landfills; and properties should be sited and elevated in a manner that protects against flooding and environmental degradation from landslides  All of these are part of going green
   	IBHS also firmly believes that adaptation is critical, not only to reduce long-term property insurance losses, but to buttress individual and societal resilience  All of the property protection measures that IBHS advocates to strengthen structures against current weather threats will also reduce future losses caused by climate change events  And, the unprecedented scientific research conducted at the unique IBHS Research Center is critical to identification of new mitigation actions that may help protect against more severe weather events
   	Additionally, research conducted by IBHS will help to make sure that green building enhancements do not inadvertently cause structures to be less disaster-resistant, or even worse, threaten the life safety of occupants or first respondersfor example, photovoltaic arrays that take flight or pose fire suppression challenges are the antithesis of building strong  

As a building science institute, and due to antitrust concerns, IBHS does not have access to, and cannot compile, a list of market-based discounts offered by specific insurers with respect to current or future weather scenarios  That said, IBHS research helps its member companies to better understand structural vulnerability and the role that mitigation plays in reducing damage from severe weather, as well as what mitigation features to look for when inspecting a residential or commercial building
   
A few states (incl Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, and South Carolina) have developed legislative or regulatory discount frameworks for homes built or retrofitted to the code-plus, hazard-specific FORTIFIED new construction and retrofit standards developed by IBHS  In these states, the Institute has worked with insurance regulators and insurance companies to make sure that the discount programs work as they were intended upon enactment, and actually facilitate risk-based pricing, which can serve both to encourage effective mitigation and discourage unsound development in disaster-prone areas 

The quickest way for individual property owners to find out if their residential or commercial building qualifies for an incentive (for example, by meeting the designation requirements of the FORTIFIED program) is to ask their insurance department or company  In addition to discounts, insurance incentives related to mitigation may include a positive decision by an underwriter to provide coverage in the voluntary, rather than through the residual, market, lower deductibles, or more favorable coverage terms relating to post-disaster claims payments  Again, these are business decisions made by individual insurers, and IBHS neither influences such decisions nor specifically tracks them

Lastly, in 2014, our parent American Family, partnered with IBHS through a first-of-its-kind national study that will support researchers over the next 25 years in making residential roofs last longer and leak less often ultimately helping customers mitigate risks The study will determine how Midwest weather affects different brands of roofing material, using a dozen small roof structures built on a bare patch of ground at American Familys corporate headquarters",5

American Economy Insurance Company," This could result in an increase in both the magnitude and volatility of losses due to severe weather events Ensuring adequate pricing for natural catastrophe risks could become more challenging, particularly given the existing regulatory regime

Severe weather related events of concern, such as hurricanes and severe thunderstorm/tornados, are localized, short-term weather related events that are a second order impact of a warming global climate While it is logical to assume that a warmer climate would increase the amount of atmospheric energy available for the formation of localized, short-term severe weather events, the precise impact to the frequency and severity of such events relative to historical levels is uncertain 

Increases in property catastrophe risk associated with climate change will manifest themselves gradually over a period of many years (decades), while policies are typically of one-year duration This allows Liberty Mutual the opportunity to adjust rates, coverages and underwriting guidelines as required in response to trends that demonstrate an increase in the frequency and/or severity of natural catastrophe events The Company will continue to closely monitor trends in catastrophe loss frequency and severity, and to employ the latest generation of computer modeling tools to estimate exposures to natural catastrophe events, adjust pricing and underwriting guidelines as necessary 

Future pricing must be sufficiently flexible and continuously incorporate the latest trend data and scientific advances in catastrophe modeling to ensure adequate risk adjusted returns on capital A significant concern is the potential for a wide divergence in the future between the consensus view of natural catastrophe risk between insurers and the regulators with authority to approve changes to pricing Many current regulatory regimes do not allow sufficient flexibility to ensure that pricing is set at actuarially sound levels, and in effect set price controls that are slow to react to changes in risk levels Should the Company be unable to raise rates consistent with any increases in natural catastrophe risk, the only viable strategic option may be to significantly restrict the amount of business written in certain markets, or possibly to exit certain markets altogether

The geographical areas impacted by climate change risk are generally those that are currently at the greatest risk for the natural catastrophe perils described above (eg, the East Coast and Gulf for hurricane, and the Central and Southern US for tornado/severe thunderstorm) Any increase in the frequency and severity of natural catastrophes may expand the boundaries of the geographic areas that are susceptible to each peril, but the areas indicated above are likely to continue to be of highest risk",3

We recognize that climate change has the potential to significantly alter global weather patterns, possibly producing more frequent and/or more intense severe convective storms and hurricanes  A warming climate may also elevate the risk of both coastal and riverine flooding  Wildfires could become more frequent and more difficult to control  However, as we continue to monitor scientific progress associated with climate research, we have not formally adopted a policy that explicitly impacts risk management decisions

With respect to operating risk, we seek to ensure that our facilities have adequate back-up in place for data, access to IT infrastructure, remote application access, etc, so that we can respond quickly to climate-related emergencies without major disruption to our business processes  These contingency plans are frequently tested and have occasionally been used in extreme weather-related incidents

When evaluating investment decisions, we typically review information in the public domain, as well as in offering documents, that detail the risks posed by the investment  These disclosures usually include details surrounding the legislative risk posed by climate-related legislation (eg, introduction of a carbon tax for industries and activities that emit significant amounts of carbon dioxide, cap and trade legislation that sets allowable limits for emissions of carbon dioxide at a mandated cap while allowing for the trading of permits among industries to encourage lower emissions, etc), dependencies on various environmentally sensitive pricing (eg, commodity or energy prices), sensitivity to weather-related phenomena (eg, insurance or reinsurance company investments, hurricane exposure to offshore energy facilities, etc) and the like  The amount of disclosure and the decision whether or not to buy or sell an investment in light of the risk (or lack thereof) will vary on a case by case basis

USAA Life Ins Co,"  We also promote weather related loss prevention and safety advice through member communications such as articles on usaacom, USAA Magazine, our eNewsletter for members, content marketing and social media promotion We also regularly promote weather related loss prevention and safety topics to the communities we live and serve through public relations efforts via the news media  
Additionally, in 2017, USAA became the title sponsor of two conferences, StormCenterLive and the National Tropical Weather Conference, both of which seek to provide updates to the meteorological and emergency management community as well as other interested parties on the latest technological and scientific findings on the causes and behavior of severe weather and apply that knowledge towards better communicating risks to the public and encouraging them to take concrete steps to mitigating their exposure to loss from severe weather events
As discussed above, USAA is also a member of many disaster-mitigation and community resiliency-focused organizations and coalitions  USAA was a founding member of IBHS and continues to support its mission to conduct objective scientific research to identify and promote the most effective ways to strengthen homes, businesses and communities against natural disasters and other causes of loss  Last year alone, IBHS research and programs were highlighted as part of many events focused on increasing resilience to weather-related events, including:
	A conference emphasizing the critical role that building codes and standards (such as Fortified) play in creating more resilient communities 
	A wildfire roundtable to discuss the many challenges related to increasing development in vulnerable areas 
	A forum on Smart Finance for Disaster Resilience focused on insurance, mortgage financing, bonds, tax incentives, and various innovative programs 
	A roundtable devoted to maximizing the resilience [return on investment or] ROI 
	An insurance resilience briefing designed to create a lasting connection between the resilience activities of the Obama and Trump Administrations  
USAA was also a founding member of FLASH and continues to support its mission [t]o promote life safety, property protection and resiliency by empowering the community with knowledge and resources for strengthening homes and safeguarding families from natural and man-made disasters  In 2016, in partnership with USAA, FLASH joined the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Agency (NOAA) and The Weather Channel to create #HurricaneStrong, a national hurricane resilience initiative that won the Outstanding Achievement in Public Awareness Award at the National Hurricane Conference  The outreach campaign, which has been extended through 2017, seeks to increase public safety and reduce damages from hurricanes by educating millions of Americans in hurricane-exposed areas with five key messages:
	Personal Safety - Know your evacuation zone 
	Family Preparedness - Build a disaster supply kit 
	Financial Security - Have an insurance checkup 
	Damage Prevention - Strengthen your home 
	Community Service - Help your neighbor  
In addition, USAA is a member of the BuildStrong Coalition; a group of firefighters, emergency responders, insurers, engineers, architects, contractors and manufacturers, as well as consumer organizations, code specialists, and many other groups committed to building a more resilient America  The coalition is dedicated to raising awareness on how disaster preparedness can help minimize risk and reduce losses to communities, businesses and families As part of the coalition, USAA advocates for federal legislation to create a national mitigation investment strategy and incentivize mitigation on a broad scale Decades of research has shown that investments in pre-disaster mitigation have significant advantages over post-disaster spending However, the federal government continues to allocate only a fraction of its total disaster spending on pre-disaster mitigation

Interinsurance Exhcnage of the Automobile Club," Examples of this include rating by roof type, age of roof, home construction type, deductibles selected, and whether the roof is covered on a replacement cost or actual cash value basis Once our policyholders understand the true cost differentials associated with choices that they make, they can then decide for themselves what steps to take to mitigate possible losses from future events

We also inform policyholders of any issues found during inspections of homes This helps the policyholder by informing them of ways that they can improve their homes resistance to losses, including those caused by climate change-influenced events We inspect the majority of all homes when they are first insured with us and re-inspect a portion of renewing policies each year as they come up for renewal 

To further encourage the reduction of losses caused by climate related events the Exchange educates about homeowner losses through our member publications In these publications we provide tips and guides to reduce losses caused by brush fire and water/weather related perils",5
Illinois Farmers Insurance Company,"  Regulatory risks as diverse as insurance regulatory obligations, emissions caps, base load management requirements, and building code requirements could impact the insurance business  Regulation, as well, can have the unintended consequence of masking risk based price signals and could cause stakeholders to increase climate related risk  rather than manage and reduce such risks  For example, subsidizing property insurance premiums, or flood insurance premiums or providing insurance or agreements to re-build in regularly eroded coastal locations or high risk fire areas could cause increase of building in such locations in a manner economically inconsistent with the physical risks presented by climate change

Regulatory uncertainty and regulation that is not economically well-grounded can create additional risk for both insurers and society  Even where public policies are well grounded in sound economic policy, multi-state and nationally active insurers will likely be required to address potentially disparate and conflicting climate policies and rules and bear the associated costs 

These generally complex issues involving the interplay of new requirements within existing legal structures create unique risks; results of the same public policy will likely be different when applied in different jurisdictions - unless the results of interplay are completely and accurately analyzed in the development of such policy

Potential unintended negative consequences of regulatory action could pose a challenge for the industry, such as where the true economic cost of new legislation has not been well thought through or where the new legislation results in a disproportionate allocation of costs of climate related risk  In addition, competing requirements could mean that compliance in one jurisdiction may not satisfy other jurisdictions, thus creating duplicative or additive expenditures in the development of adaptive risk management solutions without demonstrable economic or social benefit  Additionally, regulatory actions may restrict a company from making needed changes to its pricing or prompt litigation which could put a financial strain on the organization

As the insurance industry faces regulatory risk, they face legal risk as well  Climate-related legislation that is not well-crafted may create incentives for lawsuits in some jurisdictions  Even in the absence of new laws, there have already been and may continue to be attempts to use existing laws to bring more climate change-related litigation against sovereign entities and companies in particular sectors

With respect to an insurers own operations and physical facilities, regulatory initiatives relating to emissions limits, transportation, water and energy use could impact office planning, employee commuting patterns and general resource usage  Within Farmers, activities to help respond to these trends have begun, including telecommuting, meetings held via phone, video and webinar, recycling and other environmentally-friendly practices

Farmers also has exposure to physical risks of climate change with respect to its own operations and as a result of exposures of its insureds assumed by Farmers though insurance policies  As outlined in the previous section, the physical risks impacting Farmers customers, as a result of climate change, may generate higher volatility in claims

A growing consensus among climate change experts suggests that changing weather patterns present risks of concern related to climate change  Direct impacts such as increased frequency and severity of precipitation events, droughts, and wildfire are among the multiplicity of potential conditions that could impact ultimate loss events for insureds  The risk of these events could also pose a financial strain on the organization  Improved resilience and customers risk management actions continue to be significant foci of Farmers  The potential indirect physical and public health impact, such as increased frequency of widespread disease events and localized food and water shortages, may also affect many areas of property and casualty insurance  Such physical risks have both obvious and subtle consequences for insurers  These vulnerabilities, risks, and consequences are considered as an integrated part of the underwriting process in a manner appropriate given the tenor of the insurance instrument and the manifestation of variability, risk management vulnerability reductions and impacts

With regard to the insurers' own operations or investments, insurers, like their customers, have facilities and operations that are exposed to physical risks of climate change described above  Climate change (severe drought) may drive people/employees away from California, which could be damaging to a Southern California based company

United American Insurance Co,"  The Companies have considered the impact of climate change on its investment portfolio  Climate change regulations can pose risks to the operations and financial performance of issuers across a broad array of sectors and subsectors, including but not limited to utilities, energy, automotive, agriculture, materials, consumer and industrial manufacturing, real estate, and insurance  Industries which are most at risk from potential burdensome regulations in the near-term are those that negatively affect air and resource quality  Certain industries are exposed to additional risks from climate change, including changes in energy demand for heating and cooling, peak hydrocarbon demand, weather-driven variability in agricultural production and water availability, rising sea levels, and extreme weather events

We have considered climate change risks for all asset classes and continue to closely monitor and evaluate industry trends, regulations, and long-term risks associated with climate change for all of our holdings 

b  The Companies have adapted their investment strategy to account for issuer-specific risks associated with climate change and climate change regulations  As an example, utility investments are evaluated based upon their generation mix and carbon intensity  Energy investments are made with consideration for potential greenhouse gas emissions regulations and downside risks to global oil demand

Auto related investments are contemplated with consideration for the ongoing transition to hybrid and electric vehicles  Investment in property and casualty insurers are evaluated in light of their environmental risk management practices  Environmental stewardship, geographical diversification, and long-term sustainability are key considerations for all new investments and the Companies continue to monitor and assess risks driven by climate change and related regulatory interventions

Southern Insurance Company," Explain the ways that these risks could affect your business Include identification of the geographical areas affected by these risks

The potential risks that climate change could pose to REPUBLIC are as follows:

	In Coastal areas, principally the US Gulf coast, the potential risk of climate change is higher hurricane and tropical storm frequency and severity, which could increase losses for residential and commercial property and auto coverages 
	In Non-coastal areas the potential risk of climate change is increased convective storm frequency (wind, hail and tornado) and severity, which could increase losses for residential and commercial property and auto coverages  This could result in higher losses for REPUBLIC policies in almost any area in Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Mississippi, New Mexico and Louisiana
	Reinsurance could become more expensive and scarce if weather events become more frequent and severe  REPUBLIC adjusts its property exposures based on the availability and pricing of reinsurance protections

Northwestern Long Term Care Ins. Co.,"  The Companys risk management process includes five phases: identification, evaluation, management, monitoring, and communication Risk identification and evaluation occur both at an enterprise level and within each functional area At the enterprise level, an annual risk assessment is completed using an established framework and common risk taxonomy Information for the annual risk assessment is obtained from individuals responsible for managing risk in functional areas as well as from senior management

Risk management and monitoring are accomplished through a combination of functional areas and the corporate committee structure To aid in decision making and monitoring regarding risks, risk tolerances and guidelines have been developed, and a variety of investment, product and operational limits have been established

Risk monitors have been established for certain risks to identify instances where risk has gone beyond an established limit Risks that go beyond these limits are (1) transferred by use of hedging, reinsurance or purchase of commercial insurance, (2) reduced through changes to operational processes and strategies, or (3) accepted after thorough risk evaluation and appropriate review  Risk communication occurs through the established corporate governance structure

As an example, one visible outcome of the process described above is the existence of a group of professionals to serve as a surveillance team in order to monitor for domestic and international infectious or natural environmental events or threats which could have an adverse impact on the insurance industry by affecting public health in general or the Companys mortality and morbidity experience  This function previously had been accomplished more informally under the leadership of a medical director

Professional Insurance Company,"S) The Company is wholly-owned by Sun Life Financial Inc (SLF Inc)

Sun Life has completed data collection and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions calculations for years 2007 through 2013 for its Canadian real estate investments and leased properties in Canada Canada is home to Sun Lifes Corporate Office Sun Lifes Canadian operations accounted for approximately half of both revenues and employee population during those years As Sun Life operates globally, Sun Lifes intent is to expand its measurement and monitoring of GHG emissions to include other jurisdictions in stages, adding additional jurisdictions based on size (and therefore anticipated contribution to overall Company emissions) and availability of reliable data In early 2012, we signed a contract with a third-party vendor to track GHG emissions from business travels We now have collected one reporting year of air travel GHG emissions data With a new system in place to manage travel data, we believe it would be best to first collect a full-years worth of data before analyzing it In 2014, we have been working towards expanding the geographic coverage of calculation and reporting of  Scope 1emissions (direct emissions from sources owned or controlled by the company) and Scope 2 emissions (indirect emissions that are a consequence of the companys activities, but occur at sources owned or controlled by another companyeg, generation of purchased electricity) , to include US operations At the same time, in the regions for which we have collected consumption data and calculated emissions, we can begin to develop a deeper understanding of our emissions sources and opportunities for reduction or mitigation, so that we can develop informed goals with a sound strategy for achieving them We believe it is premature to set reduction goals without first fully understanding sources of emissions that we may practically be able to influence 

Sun Life continues to focus on opportunities to reduce energy consumption, in turn, reducing GHG emissions In our Canadian real estate investment portfolio, we have seen a decrease of approximately 18% in GHG emissions intensity (tCO2e/1000ft2) from 2009 to 2013 This portfolio accounts for more than 95% of emissions in our current inventory Owning this portfolio requires us to be an environmentally (and socially) responsible landlord  Canadian real estate investments comprise approximately 65% of the Companys total real estate investments as measured by gross leasable area Sun Lifes Canadian Real Estate Investments Team is broadening its environmental approach with a strategy to own a portfolio of real estate assets that have a sustainable footprint achieved through proactive management of their effects on the environment

"American Casualty Company of Reading, Pennsylvania"," We do, however, routinely contemplate the impact of climate change throughout the organization in various settings, including: the Emerging Hazards Committee, the Enterprise Risk Committee, the Enterprise Catastrophe Committee, and in meetings with the Board of Directors

We recognize the potential impact of climate change on our insurance book of business, the publics perception of corporate social responsibility and the regulatory environment related to climate change, including the potential impact on the value of securities issued by an entity and held in our investment portfolio

Climate change has the potential to significantly alter global weather patterns, possibly producing more frequent and/or more intense severe convective storms and hurricanes More intense storms may elevate the risk of both coastal and riverine flooding Wildfires could become more frequent and more difficult to control as drought patterns change Winter storms could drive cold weather conditions further south and into areas that are less prepared   For all of these potential weather changes, we utilize various commercially licensed software models and data to better understand the potential impact that adverse weather may have on policies we insure We also continue to monitor scientific progress to determine how climate change may impact CNA in ways not specifically accounted for by the models

With respect to operating risk, we have a Business Resiliency Program that is designed to protect employees and reputation, while keeping CNAs operations functioning at a level acceptable for serving our policyholders and shareholders in the event of a business interruption, regardless of cause As part of this program, we seek to ensure that our facilities have adequate back-up in place for data, access to IT infrastructure, remote application access, etc, so that we can respond quickly to climate-related emergencies without major disruption to our business processes These contingency plans are frequently tested and have occasionally been used in extreme weather-related incidents

We utilize our software models to determine the potential impact of weather events on all of our facilities We use this information to prioritize mitigation efforts, improve employee safety, and improve business resiliency

When evaluating investment decisions, we typically review environmental considerations posed by the investment, including, details surrounding the legislative risk posed by climate-related legislation (eg, introduction of a carbon tax for industries and activities that emit significant amounts of carbon dioxide, cap and trade legislation that sets allowable limits for emissions of carbon dioxide at a mandated cap while allowing for the trading of permits among industries to encourage lower emissions, etc), dependencies on various environmentally sensitive pricing (eg, commodity or energy prices), sensitivity to weather-related phenomena (eg, insurance or reinsurance company investments, hurricane exposure to offshore energy facilities, etc) and the like The amount of disclosure and the decision whether or not to buy or sell an investment in light of the risk (or lack thereof) will vary on a case by case basis

SWISS RE LIFE & HEALTH AMERICA INC.," We
engage with policy makers at international and national levels, business leaders in the
insurance industry and other sectors, multilateral organizations, NGOs, and others One of
our main engagement activities in recent years relates to the annual United Nations
Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) international climate negotiations
The engagement process comprises of a mixture of targeted and ad hoc actions often
carried out as an individual company but also through work with other organizations like
climate focused NGOs, and both international and US based platforms, such as the World
Economic Forum and Clinton Global Initiative In 2012 and 2013 Swiss Re worked closely
with the US-based NGO Ceres on an initiative assessing urban resilience to climate change
in the US This process has brought together insurance companies as well as city officials, property owners and academics to look for new approaches to this issue as well as how best to bring insurance industry expertise into the topic area Swiss Re also works closely with The Climate Group particularly in the US (NGO, focus: emissions reductions and the clean energy revolution) and is the founding sponsor of The Climate Group's ""Climate Week NYC"" (2009 - 2014), Oxfam America (NGO, focus: climate adaptation, integration of risk management/transfer into development projects, development of new insurance markets to tackle climate risks being faced by the most vulnerable communities) and ClimateWise (insurance industry initiative, focus: widening the commitment to a set of insurance sector related climate principles) The main topics of Swiss Re's engagement include:

- the need for a legislative response to ensure that appropriate action is taken to tackle
man-made greenhouse gas emissions;
- the need to adapt to the impacts of climate change to make society more resilient to
severe weather and the integration of climate risk consideration into the decisionmaking
process of both public and private sectors;
- the promotion of understanding that climate change can best be dealt with if it is
recognized as both a risk and opportunity;
- the development of new insurance products and services to contribute to the reduction
of greenhouse gas emissions as well as helping to manage the physical impacts of
climate risk

One of the initiatives launched by Swiss Re as part of it 150th Anniversary program is the
microsite blog ""Open Minds"" It is designed as a dialogue platform and a place to exchange
views on risks, with a focus on the risks well face in the future Alongside our clients and employees, citizens, organizations, and governments are invited to discuss how we can
come together to help find answers to some of the worlds biggest challenges Three of the
four featured topics are climate related: climate and disasters, sustainable energy, food
security

Swiss Re uses its research as a basis for engagement with policymakers and other decision
makers For example, the company's Economics of Climate Adaptation research series has
been discussed widely (eg a briefing session on this study, and insurance products to
manage climate risk, was held for various Ambassadors based in Switzerland at Swiss Re's
Centre for Global Dialogue) Other events have been held/attended presenting this topic in
various countries, including the US, Switzerland, Belgium, Australia, Canada, France and
Austria As part of the management of the climate topic, our Sustainability & Political Risk Management unit consistently identifies and evaluates opportunities to engage on the
issue This involves proactively searching for, and reactively assessing, opportunities to
address our key stakeholders on climate change This can take the form of speaking
engagements, publications, media interviews, media articles, and others We also
encourage our employees to increase their awareness of the issues presented by climate
change This can take the form of informal ""Lunch & Learn"" sessions, ""Energy Fairs"" that are held for employees at the main US, European and Asian locations to provide information and advice on climate and other environmental topics, communications on the company's internal website, or incentive schemes such as our COYou2 Reduce & Gain
programme which offers financial subsidies for the purchase of low carbon technology such
as hybrid cars and energy efficient appliances Additionally, the ""Own the Way You Work""
initiative is a Swiss Re effort to provide further workplace flexibility which will reduce
emissions from commuting

Swiss Re partners with various public and private sector stakeholders, including leading
universities, NGOs, and academic institutions to advance knowledge on the risks of climate
change Swiss Re regularly publishes a wide array of other reports related to the climate
topic from both US-centric and international perspectives: 
See: "" The hidden risks of climate change: An increase in property damage from soil subsidence in Europe"" (http://wwwswissrecom/rethinking/New_study_Rising_property_damage_from_soil_subsidencehtml);

The Economist Intelligence Unit's ""Managing the Risks in Renewable energy"" (http://digitalresearcheiucom/risksandrenewables/)

To educate the public and industry alike about the increased risk of natural catastrophes
posed by climate change, Swiss Re released its Flood Risk App in August, 2012
(http://wwwswissrecom/library/Apps/The_Flood_App_for_iPadhtml), available for free on
the iTunes App Store The Flood Risk App gives a general understanding of flood risks and
explains how to manage and insure these risks The App explores different types of flooding
and the challenges involved in making floods insurable It highlights the importance of
adapting to climate change and shows how reliable flood information can strengthen flood
preparedness The app was upgraded to provide an interactive demonstration of resilience
and factors affecting it

John Hancock Life Insurance Company Of New York,"SA) (JHUSA)  JHUSAs ultimate parent is Manulife Financial Corporation (MFC), a Canadian-based, publicly traded life insurance company  Responses to the Insurer Climate Risk Disclosure Survey are from the vantage point of MFC and its subsidiaries, including JHNY and JHLH, collectively known as Manulife (or the Company)

Governance
Manulife is committed to conducting our business in a manner that recognizes the need to preserve the quality of our environment  Manulifes Environmental Policy states that we will ensure that our risk analysis and management procedures will include consideration of environmental matters, which includes greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions  To support this, Manulifes Environmental Risk Policy applies to all business units with environmental exposure and any business or entity in which Manulife holds an equity position and the right to select, control and direct management and operations

Our Environmental Risk Policy requires business units, through their Business Unit Environmental Officers, to report annually to the Chief Environmental Officer their GHG emissions performance data and identify risks and opportunities as a result of climate change  GHG emissions data are measured in accordance with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol and are consolidated at the company level and used for reporting in Manulifes Public Accountability Statement, submissions to the CDP (formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project) and Dow Jones Sustainability Index, and various other reports throughout the year  These assessments allow the company to formulate plans to reduce or mitigate emissions in an effective manner

We have been making submissions to the CDP since 2005 and our most recent submission is publicly available on the CDPs website

Performance
Manulife has invested in systems that collect energy use and other environmental data, which allow us to set environmental targets and monitor our performance  
In 2016, we launched a new Sustainable Real Estate Policy that applies to our real estate investment, development, asset and property management activities across our global operations We have a 2 per cent year-over-year energy use reduction target in our real estate operations, which has helped us achieve a 24 per cent reduction in the intensity of greenhouse gas emissions since 2012 We are pleased to report that nearly 26 million square feet, or 41 percent of our real estate portfolio, is certified to sustainable building standard such as LEED or Energy Star

We continue to purchase renewable energy credits as a way of demonstrating our commitment to the transition to a lower carbon economy and in 2016, we purchased 29,245 MWh of renewable energy

Manulife is also reducing its emissions directly and indirectly through a number of other ongoing environmental initiatives:  

We sustainably manage approximately 24 million hectares of forests on behalf of our General Account fund and third-party investors  All eligible forestry operations are certified to independent third-party standards for environmental stewardship such as the Forest Stewardship Council and the Sustainable Forestry Initiative These working forests play an important role in mitigating and managing the impacts of climate change We plant more than two trees for every tree harvested and 2016 was a milestone year, marking the planting of our billionth tree

We invest considerably in renewable energy and energy efficiency projects  Since 2002, we have invested C$109 billion in projects that either provide clean, renewable energy or reduce energy consumption

(1)	Weather-related risks
USAA provides a full range of highly competitive financial products and services to facilitate the financial security of its members, associates, and their families, including personal lines insurance products principally in the United States Weather-related catastrophes affect a significant portion of USAAs portfolio USAA uses state-of-the-art catastrophe and economic-capital models to identify and quantify extreme catastrophe risks based on the latest scientific research The potential impacts of changing climate conditions present a challenge for current catastrophe models since there is much uncertainty surrounding its impact on hurricanes, severe thunderstorms, wildfires and winter storms Any model has risk of model-error due to the complexity of assumptions, limited prediction power and random error associated with statistical modeling The assessment of changing weather patterns leads to more uncertainty in model results USAA takes these model-error risks into account when conservatively setting capital requirements  These conservative capital requirements drive our underwriting, pricing, and reinsurance-purchase decisions and will cover potential impacts of changing weather patterns
Because many USAA members reside in catastrophe-prone areas, changing global weather-patterns add complexity to (1) the estimates of actuarially-sound rates in catastrophe-prone areas, especially coastal regions, and (2) the estimates of capital requirements for low-frequency, high-severity events A 2014 Report issued by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), along with other scientific studies published within the last few years, predict more severe droughts and floods, and possibly more intense hurricanes USAA is committed to preserving its financial strength and to being there for its members over the long-term and, as such, is taking the uncertainties surrounding natural catastrophes into consideration when setting conservative capital requirements For example, USAAs capital requirements are more conservative than levels set by regulatory and rating agencies The company is prepared to withstand a 1-in-1,000 years catastrophe event and maintains a much more conservative premium-to-surplus ratio than the standards set by regulators or rating agencies USAAs capital requirements are taken into account when setting geographic and financial growth strategies

(2)	Regulatory risks
Currently, rate regulation in the United States typically limits the amount USAA can charge in catastrophe-prone areas to the range of rates indicated by historically-calibrated models Therefore, USAA sets rates based on state-of-the-art modeling software USAA will continue to keep models updated with the latest scientific research incorporated into model assumptions and grow cautiously in catastrophe-prone areas USAA also works with federal, state, and local authorities, and non-profits as well as insurance related organizations, such as: IBHS, and the Federal Alliance for Safe Homes (FLASH), to promote wise geographical growth and building code standards for new construction 

(3)	Business Operation risks
An increase in the frequency and/or severity of catastrophic tropical storms or wild fires could have an impact on USAAs operations The Gulf Coast region and western states which are prone to wildfire could be most significantly impacted USAA has regional offices in both of these areas of the United States, and has contingency plans in place to continue world-class service to members even if a regional office is damaged Claims adjusters have mobile equipment and extensive training to enable USAA to personally respond to members needs quickly and professionally after major catastrophes anywhere in the US USAA also encourages flexible work-at-home program, which may allow employees to work from any location

With regard to managing health risks correlated with climate change, KP is uniquely positioned to 1) have early indications regarding weather/climate-related conditions through its research programs, and 2) provide timely and responsive care to members through its integrated care delivery system In terms of facility risks, KP has a robust business continuity program that ensures continued operations in the event of natural or manmade disasters
 KPs executive leadership has adopted an organizational guideline related to climate change, excerpted below:
If greenhouse gas emissions continue to increase, climate change will cause health effects that will directly impact KPs ability to fulfill our promise of quality affordable care Global climate instability will increase the demand for health care The costs of energy and water are likely to increase while supplies are diminished Threats to biodiversity could also threaten the availability of potential cures for diseases KP adopts the following principles:
1	Understand climate change
2	Assess and avoid climate-related impacts
3	Commit to continuous improvement
4	Support industry standards
5	Inform public policies

As noted in KPs response to question 1, KP has a goal to become carbon neutral in 2020, and one way that KP reduces its avoidable emissions is through large-scale investments in clean and renewable energy sources An added benefit of these investments is that, by providing KP with a long-term fixed price for electricity, they provide KP with an important hedge against potentially significant swings in energy prices resulting from climate impacts and/or climate policies

Blue Cross Blue Shield of Vermont," We had already taken steps at our community engagement events to reduce waste  carpooling, using large water coolers and compostable cups to reduce one-use plastic bottles And over the years we made changes to printing practices, switched to high-efficiency lights and improved mowing practices but with the creation of the SC significantly augmented our efforts already underway We established a working team that was cross-divisional and included all levels of the company  

The team developed the following mission and vision to provide a roadmap for the work 

Mission - We are committed to reducing our environmental impacts, building a culture of sustainability within the BLUE CROSS community of employees and creating a healthy future for our employees, clients, partners and community

Vision - We endeavor to operate a business that both improves the environment and conditions in which we live and reduces our negative impacts on the environment around us

To this end, we have accomplished several projects in the past few years, including the installation of rooftop solar panels, which created a savings of $35,000 annually Water bottle filling stations were installed throughout the building, which was coupled with a wellness campaign providing re-usable water bottles Weve installed anti-idling signage in the parking lots and educated employees about the negative impacts of idling Weve also had a review of all waste systems by the Central Vermont Solid Waste Management District We have made many changes in our cafeteria to reduce waste, including use of green boxes  cutting the use of thousands of paper takeout plates and containers to a minimum We have improved internal catering practices with the development of green meetings where paper and plastic are not used Composting efforts have also been improved, reducing trash weight yielding a savings in trash removal as well as providing clean feed for a local chicken farm In 2019 we were awarded a certificate of environmental stewardship for diverting over 20,000 pounds of food scraps from the landfill

While we have undertaken many improvements in terms of cafeteria practices and facilities, perhaps the most important is the impact on our corporate culture We have established events that have now become traditions and involve ever increasing numbers of employees every year Our How Green is Blue Day is an annual celebration of all things green and provides a great opportunity to raise awareness about various sustainability issues both local and global We also run our own Green Up, Clean Up where employee-volunteers clean trash from the surrounding roads  We have also partnered with other environmentally-conscious organizations, such as the Vermont Institute of Natural Science (VINS) raptor program to educate our employees about environmental stewardship and Local Motion to learn how we can reduce our carbon footprint by bicycling to work Employees have become increasingly engaged in the work and we now have an ambassador program because so many expressed interest in joining the committee  We continue to incorporate ways to lessen our impact on the environment and are currently developing a plan for future initiatives include applying to be a Vermont Green Business, zero waste stations, carbon offsetting and installing an electric vehicle station

While there is a potential for climate change to also affect the frequency and severity of wind related storms over a long period of time, the Company believes that a pro-active annual rate review process will over time account for any short term changes from climate change Since climate change is viewed as a long-term changing of atmospheric conditions, we do not believe it is appropriate to price for or underwrite against perils that have not yet occurred As the Company reviews changes in its own data and industry trends, we believe the short-term changes will over time build towards an adjustment for the long-term additional windstorm peril risks The Company does use hurricane models from multiple vendors to understand short term hurricane risk as the basis for short-term (one to two year) exposure management and reinsurance purchasing decisions We understand that the model vendors make updates annual to their models to account for changes that their experts believe are occurring in the frequency and severity of hurricane events Again, we believe by continually monitoring changes to the model vendor results and validating our Companys actual experience against model estimates, that the Company is well positioned to alter its long-term strategies if short-term changes arise

The Company has not stress tested any model changes that could arise from climate change The Company reviews multiple hurricane and severe convective storm models each year to gain insights on a wide range of possible outcomes The Company believes that any short-term changes are within a reasonable range of the distribution of current model estimates and that the Company buys sufficient reinsurance on an annual basis to account for a substantial range of possible outcomes

Due to the short term nature of the Companys business (annual contracts with severe weather events known during contract periods), the Company does not believe that modelling beyond the 1-5 year period is necessary As changes arise to Company or industry trends, the Company is prepared to annually make rating and underwriting decisions to mitigate future short-term risk (1-5 years), however does not view longer-term scenario testing a pertinent to the operations of the Company",7

Loyal American Life Insurance Company," Additionally, increases in energy and fuel costs may result in broader inflationary pressures from our suppliers 

We manage risks associated with energy and fuel costs through (1) our emissions reduction projects and (2) tracking and monitoring our progress toward energy reduction targets


To manage progress against our 2020 emissions reduction targets, we utilize a proprietary technology data management portal and utility tool to aggregate data for all the sustainability program efforts The utility tool provides a detailed dashboard of energy cost, consumption and variance across our real estate portfolio  in addition to ENERGY STAR® ratings  Cigna currently has 34 sites enrolled in the US Environmental Protection Agencys ENERGY STAR® program Additionally, all 12 Cigna office locations in the United Kingdom hold ISO 50001 Energy Management System Accreditations

From 2016-2018, we have invested approximately $375 million in completed projects to help make the buildings in our global real estate portfolio more energy efficient Please note that this investment figure largely represents HVAC system replacements that were undertaken as part of our comprehensive, multi-year renovation at corporate headquarters



Risk: Tropical cyclones (hurricanes and typhoons)Increases in the frequency and severity of extreme weather events, such as hurricanes and typhoons, could impact our business services distribution capacities, and may cause damage to physical assets    

Cigna is committed to excellence in helping our customers enhance and extend their lives and protect their financial security Such a commitment requires that we be prepared to provide our services and offer our products virtually without fail  Cigna's Customer Disaster Response also may need to make temporary policy changes, such as waiving various medical requirements, refilling prescriptions and expanding its help line, to proactively address customer service issues and provide personal assistance and support for all affected by a disaster       

Additionally, Cignas Employee Assistance Program (EAP) may open its telephone lines to offer members of the impacted communities access to trained clinicians via the telephonic EAP services, regardless if callers have Cigna EAP or not The EAP may also offer immediate access to on-site Critical Incident Services (CISD) support for Cigna clients

Management methods include the following:  (1) Cignas Business Continuity Planning and Data Center Recovery plans sets forth procedures for data recovery, continuation of business functions and the use of supporting technology to recover critical business operations in the event of hurricanes and other unexpected disruptions The plans are updated and documented annually Cignas data center recovery plans are tested routinely with end-user evaluations of the restored systems as part of the testing protocol  (2) Cignas critical applications run in hardened sites protected by an emergency generator Weve also repatriated core elements of our recovery capability including infrastructure to recover the top prioritized business functions and related computer applications through data and server replication  (3) To support clients, we have an online Disaster Resource Center, which is updated to offer resources specific to an area and incident Paired with an intimate knowledge of the provider network, Our Employee Assistance Consultant team area trained to respond quickly in the event of hurricanes  (4) We also obtain insurance and make investments to protect our facilities from hurricane risk    

These management methods have not reduced the likelihood of this risk, however; we believe that these methods have reduced this risks potential magnitude over the next 1-7 years

Risk: ReputationCorporate reputation on performance related to environmental responsibility, particularly on issues related to climate change, is increasingly important to our corporate clients as evidenced by the frequent occurrence of sustainability questions on RFPs for potential corporate clients and RFIs from existing ones Also, our reputation on performance related to climate change issues is becoming increasingly important to our employees, investors and other stakeholders

Management methods include the following: (1) Guided by our Strategic Sustainability Performance Plan, we make continued investments to support our energy strategy and 2020 emissions reduction targets; (2) In 2018, we had our Scope 1 and 2 emissions assured for the fourth consecutive year; (3) We closely monitor and respond to requests from corporate clients (including RFPs and RFIs) and requests related to climate change and corporate responsibility; (4) We gather and report on performance data both internally and externally; and (5) We also engage stakeholders, employees and corporate employer clients to enhance continuous improvement in the implementation of sustainability programs, which include our GreenSTEPS employee engagement program and focus groups, surveys and interviews conducted as part of a multi-faceted materiality exercise currently in process

We believe that  if Cigna did not engage in these current management methods - both the likelihood and magnitude of this risk over the next 1-3 years would be higher   However, we acknowledge the importance of continuously improving and responding to evolving stakeholder concerns and expectations to reduce the likelihood and potential magnitude of this risk

	Trees and landscaping around the perimeter of the buildings are designed to shade the building to reduce cooling loads
	Replaced our physical IT server environment with a virtualized server environment This upgrade to IT systems is expected to reduce electricity usage

Recycling  

	We monitor print and are committed to reducing the amount of print generated in our operations through the use of electronic communications and reporting We also work to identify print that can be eliminated or reduced
	Paper correspondence received is imaged and filed electronically This allows us to recycle virtually all of the paper received or produced
	Recycling was a focus in the design and materials used in the new building For example, the terrazzo flooring in the new building is made from recycled porcelain plumbing fixtures and the carpeting was manufactured by InterfaceFLOR using 25% post consumer or bio based materials 
	Personal hygiene products used in the restroom facilities are manufactured from recycled or renewable resource paper products

Water Conservation  
	All of the fixtures in the McKinney Texas restroom facilities are low flow fixtures

The First Liberty Insurance Corporation,"  These models are continuously updated to incorporate the latest available scientific information related to severe weather perils, and are regularly updated with the most current policy-level exposure data to enable Liberty Mutual to monitor changes in severe weather catastrophe exposure  Use of these models is incorporated into the underwriting process and aids in the development of risk selection guidelines  In addition, catastrophe modeling is an important factor in establishing pricing differentials for individual risks as well as setting program rate structures  These measures enable Liberty Mutual to effectively manage its natural catastrophe exposure portfolio

Liberty Mutual has a dedicated corporate Catastrophe Risk Assessment unit which has the responsibility for estimating the potential financial impacts of the Companys catastrophe risk exposure  This unit is a vital component of Liberty Mutuals ERM program and uses probabilistic catastrophe models as well as other means such as industry benchmarking, realistic disaster scenarios and historical loss experience to estimate the potential impact of catastrophes 
Severe natural catastrophes are incorporated into a stress testing regime, which Liberty Mutual performs regularly as a component of its ERM program  Stress testing ensures that the Company understands in detail the financial impacts (earnings, capital and liquidity) of various deterministic stress scenarios, or combinations of scenarios  In this way the Company can ensure that its current portfolio of exposures does not result in a capital or liquidity impact that exceeds established tolerances

The Companys dedicated emerging risks unit actively monitors the latest developments related to climate change risks as respects liability lines, including with regard to potential application of various exclusions and other general liability policy provisions to climate change related claims

MIC Property & Casualty Insurance Corporation,"  With regard to dealer inventory programs, the company works with policyholders to develop and implement loss mitigation strategies in the event of extreme weather conditions The company does not view these loss mitigation strategies as a response to climate change, but rather a response to weather situations that have occurred throughout the years",5
A.Central Insurance Company," Concerning the frequency and severity of hurricanes, for example, the current information is conflicting Risks in hurricane prone areas are being managed through the use of modeling and risk management   Policyholders are encouraged to take steps to mitigate potential damage At this time, we continue to monitor our exposure due to climate change This is monitored by our ERM committee, chaired by our Chief Risk Officer, who reports to the Board of Directors We have a designated point person to coordinate climate change risk, as all areas of the corporation have been tasked with monitoring the risks to our operations related to climate change",1
LifeMap," The process has four integrated components While assessing the risks during the risk assessment process, each risk is rated keeping in mind the financial impact to Cambia If a climate risk were to be identified during our risk assessment process, the current process will enable us to assess the degree of its impact to Cambia
 
From a financial liquidity perspective we do not test or take specific measures directly related to climate change We do not model and review the adequacy of our surplus and liquidity as a result of higher utilization of healthcare services We look to ensure that we have adequate layers of liquidity to meet these potential needs

Stillwater Ins. Cp.,"  The Business Continuity Plan addresses emergency personnel resource requirements, temporary business output outsourcing and network/technology back-up processes  The Disaster Recovery Plan addresses restoration of the physical assets utilized in the operation of the business
Company management believes that future trends in the following areas might deviate substantially from historical trends:  (a) increased losses due to the winds remaining at hurricane strength for longer periods of time caused by higher sustained heat levels, (b) increased hurricane and flood related losses due to higher water levels in general, (c) increased losses from more frequent convective storms caused by higher sustained heat levels and (d) increase in fire losses caused by sustained change in rain patterns resulting in a damaging combination of arid conditions that are more susceptible to fires and lower water tables to combat  These events would increase the Companys exposure to higher losses across all lines of business, but in particular our Homeowner, Allied Lines, Fire and EQ lines which, for calendar year 2018, represented approximately 88% of written premium
As stated above, the Company licensed its own RMS cat modeling software to model the impact of hurricane, conductive storm, storm surge, wildfire and earthquake activity  The Company also licensed Arc GIS, sophisticated mapping software, to further model its catastrophic exposure in concentration
The Company seeks to mitigate both its catastrophic and aggregate exposure to climate-related risk with (a) geographic diversification, (b) aggressive rate challenging, (c) transfer of risk to policy holders via peril-specific exclusions in risk-prone areas and pricing incentives for higher deductibles, (d) transfer of risk via catastrophic, aggregate, facultative, and quota share reinsurance, (e) product mix balancing targets and (f) maintenance of a healthy surplus

Aetna Health of California,"1e:  For the last several years Aetna's Scope 1 emissions have been similar composing a small percentage of total Scope 1 and 2 emissions Aetna's Scope 2 emissions are the greater of the two (Scope 1 and Scope 2) To a large extent Aetna's Scope 2 emissions are dictated by the location of the offices we occupy Different regions of the US rely on different fuel sources for electricity production and thus have emission factors associated with electrical production The majority of the locations Aetna occupies are also leased sites; Aetna has limited ability to impact electrical consumption (and hence emissions and target setting) at these locations 
Aetna's locations' electricity consumption will probably be dictated to a large part by weather conditions, eg, outside temperatures Aetna's aggregate Scope 1 and 2 emissions will probably be similar to previous years' It is anticipated that Aetna's emissions over the next five years will be similar to previous years' emissions
We have emission reduction initiatives that were active during the reporting year  The chart below outlines the total number of projects at each stage of development, and for those within the implementation stages, the estimated CO2e savings:

EMPLOYERS Assurance Company," Our asset managers, Conning Asset Management, has an informal process in place which takes into consideration both internal and external factors that would affect the ability of insurers to repay debts, remain competitive and maintain a strong financial position Climate change issues, other environmental and legal scenarios and part of that consideration in analyzing industries and bond issuers Our assets managers are a signatory to the United Nations Principles for Responsible Investment group and climate change is one focus of the group",4
State Auto Mutual Insurance Company,"  State Auto believes its personal and commercial property insurance products are most exposed to climate-related risks due to the impact on weather patterns and related losses  Changing weather patterns present risks related to climate change which could affect any or all of the geographical areas in which the company operates We manage the growth of property business along the Gulf and Atlantic coasts to allow for increased exposure over targeted and geographically diverse areas We model our exposures along the coasts for hurricane damage along with our Midwest and Southeastern business that may be impacted by convective storms 

Among the varied business risks State Auto faces related to climate change are:
¿	Volatility of results due to possible changes in frequency, severity and/or locations of weather-related events and resulting claims;
¿	Storm surge risk resulting from anticipated rising sea levels;
¿	Inland flood risk exposures increase with changes in storm frequency and severity; 
¿	Wildfire risk;   
¿	Regulatory challenges or constraints to charging appropriate rates that consider possible weather changes and related losses;
¿	Market share of business being impacted by disproportionate growth of population, property and commerce in certain geographic areas;
¿	Disproportionate impact of climate change on certain classes of insureds, which could in turn affect the companys business; 
¿	Availability and cost of reinsurance; 
¿	Disproportionate impact of climate change on specific investments in the portfolio; 
¿	Extreme weather preventing the employees ability to perform necessary operational and service functions

State Auto considers such risks among many risk factors addressed by its overall risk management program  The Boards of Directors provide oversight to the risk management programs

Michigan Millers Mutual Insurance Company, Given our analysis (see item 4 above) we believe this is the most cost efficient and effective manner in which we can accomplish this activity,5
Nationwide Insurance Company of Florida," Included within these risk mitigation efforts is the application of fortified standards developed by the Insurance Institute for Business and Home Safety (IBHS) As part of this program, mitigation credits can be earned by our customers thus reducing the premium we charge along with reducing the potential future losses due to weather-type events Nationwide also offers a home inventory process that allows consumers the ability to track their personal belongings for when an unfortunate event occurs Nationwide mailed information to 55,000 of our members in high wildfire hazard areas in Western states in the Spring of 2015 The mailing provided them with a website and information from IBHS on how to make their homes and businesses safer from wildfire

In addition, to continue driving more awareness around the benefits from risk mitigation, Nationwide is implementing a new endorsement focused on replacing roofs according to the different IBHS standards at the time of an eligible loss which will result in a more weather-proofed roof IBHS guidance for mitigating property losses is available directly to the public at wwwdisastersafetyorg Increased risk sharing through the utilization of wind/hail deductibles is also being implemented to help encourage consumers to proactively mitigate weather claims In addition, Nationwide is active at the local and national level to help drive the necessary building code changes to make homes safer Nationwide is an active member of the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) Wildland and Rural Fire Protection committee This is a committee that develops codes, standards, and recommended practices for fire protection infrastructure used in land development in wildland, rural, and suburban areas

As catastrophe risk increases in certain markets, Nationwide continues to invest in the necessary tools to better understand the risk, whether it be hurricanes, severe thunderstorms or wildfires Financially, the importance of geographic diversification within Nationwides portfolio is one of the key levers to being a successful property insurer Included within this work is the integration of risk management findings into pricing, product development and distribution planning along with consumer education

Along similar lines, Nationwide constructed one of the first ever commercial buildings in San Antonio that is certified as fortified according to IBHS standards and we have also built a second office building to those standards in downtown Columbus The company continues to not only help drive these types of changes within the community but across the different businesses In partnership with home builders, banks, consumers, IBHS and legislatures, the necessary changes will need to occur leading to improvements in building codes and risk management in general

From a commercial standpoint, Nationwide provides education and loss control services to assist customers in identifying risks, ways to mitigate risks along with including exclusionary language for certain risk types within its contracts Through individual risk pricing modifications, those consumers who respond to these services in a positive manner could be eligible for improved pricing considerations

Wisconsin Physicians Service Insurance Corporation,  Climate change-risk would be naturally incorporated into any underwriting process for a specific client but it not material enough to warrant a separate process,2
Alterra Excess and Surplus Insurance Company,"  Below is the overall Markel Group response, which is how the climate risk environment is currently being managed on a go-forward basis, even though this survey is for 2012

General Overview of Survey:
Markel Corporation, the parent and sole shareholder of Alterra Excess and Surplus Insurance Company (the Company)views and manages its risks at a consolidated level, not on a per insurance company legal entity basis  

The Company's insurance operations are office-based and, consequently, do not produce significant emisions in comparison to, for example, industrial operations  The Company seeks to operate efficiently and to minimize waste, which contributes to reduced emissions  The Company has also moved forward on a variety of ""paperless"" office initiatives in recent years, which contribute to efficiencies and have the secondary effect of reducing emissions

As previously reported, the Company continues to consolidate datacenters where and when possible across Markel North America  In 2012, 4 remote datacenters were consolidated into the datacenter located at the Company's headquarters  The Company has made significant progress over the past year in virtualizing our environment, and currently estimates a 95% virtualization of servers  Virtualization is a process whereby applications are run in separate, isolated partitions (separate virtual machines) within a single server  Widely used in datacenters, each virtual machine runs its own operating system and application and can be moved or copied from one server to another for load balancing or to expand processing capability  Along with greater utilization of hardware, this ""live migration"" feature is one of the major benefits of using virtual servers

The Company's affiliated non-insurance operations tend to engage in light manufacturing or service businesses and are not significant producers of emissions",0
Midwest Family Mutual Insurance," If we are aware of areas with a higher propensity for losses, we act accordingly",3
American Economy Insurance Company," Below is an overview of Libertys energy reduction initiatives, recognitions, and awards

LEED Building Certification 

 Liberty Mutual has earned LEED certification for six buildings and ENERGY STAR labels for eight buildings 
 To meet the guidelines for these standards, the Company applies a wide range of energy efficiency strategies including the addition of energy-efficient bulbs that use under one watt of energy per square foot, automatic flush toilets and automatic water spouts, lighting control systems that turn lights off after business hours in all common hallways, and occupancy sensors that control lights in offices and conference rooms 
 As the Company builds new and retro-fits existing buildings to LEED standards, Liberty Mutual mandates that all construction contractors on its work sites follow indoor air quality guidelines and practices Examples include using recycled/recyclable carpet, low VOC (volatile organic compounds) adhesives, sealants, and paints Liberty Mutuals 22-story Boston office building was designed to be more energy efficient than a typical large modern office building and has achieved LEED Silver certification 
 At the Companys Dover, NH facility, Liberty Mutual replaced all of the 1,000-watt metal halide parking lot lights with 288-watt LEDs lights for a savings of 712 watts per fixture and a cost reduction of $458 per light Overall, the LED lights have shown a 60 percent to 70 percent savings each month compared to the old metal halides Because of the success of the light replacement project in NH, Liberty Mutual recently installed 28 LED lights in its Weston office parking lot
 Old office furniture and supplies from the Boston, Weston, and NH offices are donated to the Furniture Trust 
 By maintaining a focus on energy reduction initiatives as well as on implementing building operating best practices, Liberty Mutual continues to drive down overall energy consumption across its owned building portfolio

Catering and Cafeteria 

 Liberty Mutual has two recycling programs for excess food in its Boston facility and implemented the same programs at Plano, TX in 2018 Liberty Mutual also plans to implement these programs in other facilities within the year The programs are:
o The Boston facility has a composter into which all unused food waste goes In 2017, 159 tons of organic waste was produced and recycled The compost is then donated to a local farm where it is bagged and sold as fertilizer 
o The Bring Your Own Cup Program continues to be encouraged to reduce disposable cup usage
 Liberty Mutual is piloting the use of compostable and re-usable dinner wares in the new Plano cafeteria, so the Company may have an opportunity to learn and apply this to other cafeterias during major remodels or when opening new locations 
 The Companys cafeteria partner, Eurest, has a sustainability program that includes sourcing fish from a sustainable supply chain, adjusting menu options to be more sustainable (example: less beef, more produce), using Imperfectly Delicious Produce (produce that would be discarded in the field because it is not cosmetically perfect), cage-free eggs, reducing the amount of wasted food during preparation, sourcing ingredients locally if possible, etc

Paper, Printing and Office Supplies

 The Companys Records Management department works closely with a record storage vendor to shred and recycle files eligible for destruction Through its secure shredding program, in 2017 Liberty Mutual recycled 2,417 short tons of paper, which were transported to paper mills for pulping resulting in the following eco-friendly results: 3,500,687 pounds of CO2 avoided, 40,567 trees saved, 66 million gallons of water conserved, and approximately 12,088 cubic yards of landfill space conserved 
 Through Print$mart, in 2017 employees conserved 156 million gallons of water, saved 18,424 trees, reduced CO2 emissions by 2,184 tons and reduced gas emissions by 768 tons
 Office supply order minimums cuts down on emissions by reducing the number of deliveries Further, we purchase office supplies that are manufactured with an average of 37% post-consumer content During 2017, these initiatives have saved 215,959 gallons of water, 474 trees, 44,847 pounds of CO2 and 42,555 kWh 

Auto Program and Commuting 

 100% of the companys automotive fleet consist of either PZEV (partial zero emission vehicle) or flex-fuel vehicles 
 In 2017, the company reduced its fleet by 23%, reduced business miles driven by 88%, and transitioned 62% of its fleet from 6 to 4 cylinder vehicles These changes to the vehicle program resulted in a positive impact of 2,243 tons of CHG saved in the same period from 2016 to 2017 
 Liberty Mutual offers employees the ability to purchase pre-tax transit and monthly parking permits and encourages employee usage of commuting alternatives to driving alone 
 At office locations with the largest employee populations, Liberty Mutual has partnerships with local transit agencies and other stakeholders to tailor our employee commuter amenities to the commuting demographic of the area Some of these offerings include priority rideshare parking, electrical charging stations, commuter counseling, and lockers and showers for cyclists and those who commute by foot 
 Through these efforts, Liberty Mutual is aiding employees with their commutes and meeting the various state trip reduction regulations These regulations are state, county, or city specific and require businesses of certain sizes to achieve a defined reduction of single occupant commuting vehicles These efforts also help Liberty Mutual contribute to national standards around the reduction of carbon emissions

Progressive Express Insurance Company," We address climate risk predominately within our pricing and risk management groups We also consider climate risk in our business continuity plans and our investment portfolio We assess reinsurance and economic capital needs for climate-related risks within our Enterprise Risk Management organization Economic Capital is defined as the amount of capital needed and held for an organization to survive or to meet a business objective over a specified period of time at a selected confidence level, given its risk profile  Our pricing group handles product pricing exposures Individual operating units complete Business Continuity readiness plans, which are then assessed by our Control and Analysis (ie, audit) Department for functionality Hurricane, flood, hail and extreme winter weather activity is also modeled and assessed by Risk Management who determines the amount of economic capital needed to withstand climate related events To do this we generate probable maximum loss estimates both on an individual risk basis (type of storm) as well as on an aggregated enterprise-wide level",1
Agri General Insurance  Company," In this discussion Mr Greenberg writes:

We and our industry have an opportunity and responsibility to do our part to support society in managing a risk environment that is both volatile and changing due to global climate change Our response is guided by our core business competencies and values, and our perspective begins with the obvious: We are an insurance company and our job as underwriters is to assess and manage risk using analysis that is datadriven and apolitical Applying this approach to the perils of climate change, we recognize a growing global risk that requires action from government, the private sector and, in fact, society at large to manage and mitigate the growing threat 

As an insurer, our first responsibility is to use our expertise in risk management to provide products and services that protect individuals, businesses and communities against the effects of climate change We manage risk  thats our business We employ sophisticated modeling and have considerable data that identify the physical and economic impact of climaterelated risk on individuals, businesses and communities, and this is reflected in the prices we charge for insurance protection We essentially serve as a market signal of the rising costs of climate change  as the risk increases, insurance prices increase, or availability becomes more limited

Chubb uses internal and external data together with sophisticated analytical, catastrophe loss and risk modeling techniques to ensure an appropriate understanding of risk, including diversification and correlation effects, across different product lines and territories We recognize that climate changes and weather patterns are integral to our underwriting process and we continually adjust our processes to address them This approach is intended to help ensure that losses are contained within our risk tolerance and appetite for individual product lines, businesses and Chubb as a whole Climate-related risks like flood and wildfire are continually monitored where exposure exists Extensive work has been done to understand the potential climate impacts to our view of risk as determined by the catastrophe models we use For example, we have stress tested our US hurricane model using IPCC scenarios

The potential physical risk effects of climate change  the frequency and severity of natural catastrophes, particularly those involving flooding  present potential positive, market-related financial implications for Chubb through physical and transition risks and opportunities Clients are provided with insurance protection from the impact of flooding events that may be more frequent or severe due to climate change The companys modeling of flood risk, for example, has improved to the extent that our specialized understanding of the risk enabled us to increase our flood insurance lines of business Work has also been done to understand the impact of sunny day flooding on our insurance portfolio, which is coastal flooding not associated with a specific weather event These events have become more frequent and severe as sea levels rise due to climate change Another example is how we view the evolving nature of wildfire risk, including concentrations of that risk in the wildland urban interface The results of our CAT analysis have had a substantive financial and strategic impact on our business in certain US western states

Complementing our insurance coverage, Chubb risk engineers work with our commercial and consumer clients to moderate the risks from climate change perils and make them more resilient We bring deep technical knowledge to this work, from providing guidance on construction standards, wildfire land management and coastal protection to the development of lithium battery storage systems

The companys Executive Committee, which includes the Chairman and CEO and Chubbs most senior executive leaders, has responsibility for ensuring that Chubbs ESG and citizenship activities, including those related to climate-related issues, are consistent with the companys culture, values and corporate mission Chubbs General Counsel is responsible for monitoring ongoing ESG/citizenship activities, reporting periodically to the Nominating and Governance Committee of the Board on those activities and also raising any new climate-related issues which may involve advocacy or specific corporate action to the Committees attention, for review and direction

Effective risk governance for Chubb requires close and dynamic collaboration as well as a strong focus on communication Risks are evaluated constantly and on an ongoing basis, with the companys senior management actively engaged in each risk The companys Risk and Underwriting Committee, product boards and risk-related committees meet either monthly or quarterly to evaluate specific risks and risk accumulations in Chubbs business activities and investments, while the Board of Directors Risk and Finance Committee meets regularly with company management At the Board level, the Nominating and Governance Committee charter has responsibility for reviewing environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues, including climate change Chubb's General Counsel has management oversight for the company's ESG initiatives, including climate Various risk-related reports are provided at least quarterly to business division management, product boards and other risk-related committees, senior management, the Risk and Underwriting Committee, the Risk and Finance Committee, as well as the full Board The Boards Risk and Finance Committee (R&F) helps execute the Boards supervisory responsibilities pertaining to enterprise risk management (ERM)

Under the auspices of the Global Head of Operations, GHG measurement and reduction activities are managed in Chubbs network of more than 500 offices world-wide 

Climate-related opportunities in Chubbs global insurance operations are evaluated and pursued as appropriate by the companys senior business unit managers, including Chubbs environmental risk insurance practice

Chubb has a comprehensive, coordinated global environmental program that is embedded in all areas of the organization The companys Chief Communications Officer (CCO) is the senior executive responsible for overseeing this program The CCO is responsible for the companys corporate communications, investor relations and corporate environmental functions, reports to the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Chubb and is a member of the companys senior management team The goals and objectives of the environmental program are approved by the CEO and the CCO provides regular updates to the CEO and modifies the program as necessary

The Company also utilizes 3rd party models that include some element of climate assessment on the future development of claims An increase in frequency and severity of weather related events will not be a linear increase each year and may be affected by other factors such as cyclical sea surface temperature patterns over decades (eg, Atlantic multi-decadal oscillation  AMO)

Underwriting decisions are affected by the understanding of changes to severity / frequency events  This results in greater scrutiny of required rates year-on-year in perceived weather exposed regions, greater control of exposures where weather-related issues are prevalent and as necessary, changes to underwriting appetite for risk, reflecting the perceived changes in exposure

Natinwide Affinity Insurance Company of America," NWIs primary responsibility is to adhere to the investment and compliance policies established by its clients In accordance with the investment policies of the clients, NWI has a duty to assess the risks and opportunities of potential and current investments, which include those arising from climate change Therefore, NWIs credit research team considers both climate change and environmental regulations and disclosures along with many other factors in its assessment of the business risks and opportunities of all current and potential investments NWI also considers the effects of legislative action at the portfolio level when allocating funds across asset classes
The potential long-term effects of climate change are considered in a number of ways across the asset classes where NWI actively invests on behalf of its clients Some examples:
	For real estate/commercial mortgage loan investments, the potential impact of climate change factors into the evaluation/underwriting process by considering proximity to coastal areas and increased risk of tropical storm damage 
	For municipal bond investments, the ability of the bond issuer (ie municipality) to repay debt is largely influenced by the health of its local economy and stability of its population (tax) base Climate-change issues ranging from water scarcity in the Southwest to coastal migration in Florida are considered when evaluating potential investments
	For corporate bond and equity investments, we review a companys policy and practice to manage climate change and environmental risks in order to assess their potential impact on overall credit worthiness We also actively monitor industry sectors that are more sensitive to climate change and environmental risks

When assessing and managing all of these risks, we consider overall company financial exposure, including insured coverage, not just investment risk

The Risk Consulting division of AXA XL works closely with corporate clients to help them translating climate hazards into a risk, which means quantifying the physical and economic impacts of climate change on their assets and business operations and implementing appropriate risk metrics into decision-making process AXA XL Risk Consulting services models the unique vulnerability of assets to hazards, eg estimate the physical damage associated to a given flood water depth, and quantify a wide range of direct and indirect economic consequences, such as the property damage associated with the said flood, the risk of disruption of the upstream supply chain or downstream distribution, the risk of interruption of production Some recent examples of analyses performed by risk consulting to support AXA XL clients are: 
	natural hazards prioritization analysis, aimed to identify regions and sites  among a clients portfolio, or supply chain  potentially more affected by natural hazards, as of today and due to climate change in the next 30 years; 
	water stress risk assessment, ie the assessment of potential water shortage and related impacts on business continuity and communities, as of today and in the next 30 years 
In addition to risk assessment, risk engineering is also able to support clients in tailoring the best risk mitigation strategy, and identify which countermeasures should be taken to control losses, or accelerate the pace and scale of adaptation, for instance reducing the physical vulnerability of assets by retrofitting, identifying alternate suppliers, creating backup stocks, or transfer risks, etc

Within AXA XL we have taken steps to encourage policyholders to reduce the losses caused by climate change-influenced events Our property risk consultants evaluate policyholders property exposures and provide recommendations to reduce the potential for property losses from natural catastrophe events (including hurricane, storm surge, earthquake and flood events) 

We have also helped our customers manage the fire peril This includes advice to reduce carbon emissions from the fires smoke plume, managing firefighting water runoff, the need to remanufacture damaged building materials, inventory, and equipment, and the need to place damaged material that cannot be recycled in a landfill 

We have approximately 300 risk professionals across AXA XL This includes Account Consultants that help clients to understand their portfolio, manage their risk and prioritize risk improvement activities; as well as Property, Machinery Breakdown, Construction and Environmental Loss Prevention Consultants in the field globally, who visit our customers key locations to help identify and mitigate risk These risks include pre-emergency planning and preparation, as well as developing recommendations on how to further improve site protection Specific areas of focus in wind-prone areas include detailed wind inspections to help our customers ensure they have the necessary protection in place to withstand hurricane-force winds Another key activity our consultants focus on is categorizing the flood hazard for every location they visit For those locations in flood-prone areas, they conduct detailed Flood Loss Estimates as well as survey current protection in place and recommend enhancements AXA XL has invested in their state-of-the-art Global Risk Maps tool, that gives consultants access to multiple flood assessment sources of information AXA XL Risk Consulting also has an active partnership with the University of Naples Federico II for flood and earthquake research

We regularly advise our clients on how to ensure that well-meaning energy saving products do not adversely contribute to a fire or make the facility more vulnerable to natural catastrophe losses We advise them on how to quickly recover from losses that do occur, which includes pre-planned and engineered environmental remediation strategies In addition, AXA XL is a member of the Insurance Institute for Business & Home Safety (IBHS), which identifies and promotes effective actions that strengthen homes, businesses, and communities against natural disasters and other causes of loss

Insurance products represent an important tool to mitigate the impacts that climate change-related events have on our clients business and on countries economies Yet the difference between economic and insured losses (the protection gap), particularly in developing markets that are disaster-prone, remains significant As an active member of organizations like InsuResilience and the Insurance Development Forum (IDF), AXA as well as AXA XL, dedicate significant efforts to help close the protection gap The IDF brings together private sector insurers, reinsurers and brokers, together with the World Bank and the United Nations Development Program, with the aim to support the G20 InsuResilience objective of insuring 400m more people in emerging countries by 2020 against climate-related disasters and of improving their climate resilience AXA XL plays an active part in this  effort In addition, as Chairman of the IDF, AXA Chairman Denis Duverne regularly speaks at conferences and events dedicated to raising awareness of climate related risk in the industry and beyond

Several insurance products underwritten by AXA XL serve to encourage policyholders to become more sustainable For example, AXA XLs Environmental Liability team in France offers two biodiversity-related products: an Environmental Risks policy covering Environmental Impairment Liability and Guarantee, and a M&A Environmental policy that facilitate the rehabilitation of former polluted industrials sites and help limit artificialization of soil and biodiversity loss In 2020, AXA XL France partnered with the broker Marsh to better preserve biodiversity by encouraging clients to carry out Biodiversity impact assessments and integrate the results into their accident risk prevention and management plan Joint clients with Marsh, meeting the above criteria, are offered a 25% reduction of the deductible for Environmental Risks policies

AXA XLs North America Construction business has developed tailored Builders Risk insurance programs to address clients mass timber project risks Mass timber, which includes cross-laminated timber (CLT) is gaining popularity in North America Its also considered a more sustainable building material; according to the Wood Council, replacing steel with mass timber would reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 15% to 20% The process of manufacturing timber uses substantially less fossil fuel energy per unit volume than steel, concrete, or aluminum, meaning that timber has a lower carbon footprint

Within AXA XL we share internally generated thought leadership through our online magazine Fast, Fast Forward, which includes articles produced by our environmental subject matter experts In 2020 for example, the Risk Consulting team published an article about preparing industrial facilities for the effects of wildfires The full article is available here:  https://axaxlcom/fast-fast-forward/articles/preparing-industrial-facilities-for-the-far-reaching-effects-of-wildfires

There are different types of risk (ranging from business to physical and other risks) affecting our com-pany and business, which are monitored and evaluated by specialized departments Risks may be driven by changes in regulation, in physical climate parameters, and other climate-related develop-ments
As described above, Munich Re Group faces various climate change related risks explained in detail in the CDP 2013: One example of other regulatory drivers could include the introduction of limits for greenhouse gas emissions or duties to inform/report/disclose the amount of greenhouse gases pro-duced by a product/service, or regulation changing building codes to prevent damage by extreme weather events
This may lead to liability claims based on noncompliance with such regulation (eg duties to inform, disclose or report, greenwashing/greenbuilding claims) A fundamental change in regulation or court decisions could also lead to successful claims because of greenhouse gas emissions as such Even if claims are unsuccessful, they could give rise to substantial defense costs in the US, owing to the ab-sence of a loser-pays rule Regulation changing building codes to prevent damage from extreme weather conditions could increase costs involved in rebuilding damaged/destroyed buildings covered by liability or property lines of business Potential plaintiffs could be victims of natural catastrophes (eg hurricanes like Katrina) or of rising sea levels (eg inhabitants of small islands)
Following (i) the potential financial implications of the risk before taking action; (ii) the methods you are using to manage this risk and (iii) the costs associated of the above mentioned example (taken from CDP 2013 answer):
i)The potential financial risk Munich Re faces relates to clients/insurance products and not to Munich Re as a company, as Munich Re itself produces a small level of emissions compared to other indus-tries; hence direct regulatory risks are rather unlikely Especially property insurance regularly covers losses that can be associated with the impact of climate change (CC) (eg changing frequen-cy/intensity of weather-related natural catastrophes) Whether liability for greenhouse gas emissions as such could be covered by liability insurance seems doubtful (emissions are intentional, not acci-dental; therefore no occurrence, pollution exclusion, etc) Losses indirectly related to CC (eg liability of architects/engineers for causing damage by not sufficiently considering global warming and its con-sequences) are often covered under liability insurance (eg PI, D&O) Therefore insurance coverage is generally available
Financial implications are difficult to quantify at the moment Losses indirectly related to CC are not a separate category, so little precise data is available Risks connected with CC, especially defense costs, could be a criterion for consideration in certain liability lines of business, especially if such litiga-tion increases in frequency
Outlook
It is necessary to distinguish between
¿ Direct liability for CO2 emissions as such: unlikely, but higher defense costs for likely defendants if occurrence clause makes coverage for such claims possible
¿ Indirect liability (= liability related to CC): likely to increase in importance due to stricter regulation leading to stricter liability and standards of care and to greater public awareness due to intensive me-dia coverage and growing consensus about man-made global warming
Liability related to CC (indirect climate liability) is likely to increase constantly (claims based on non-compliance with regulations or professional duties, eg failure to warn or inform), on conspiracy to mislead consumers/the public/legislation/courts by greenwashing or greenbuilding, shareholder liti-gation (if financial loss of shareholders is, for example, caused by non-compliance with climate related regulation, not sufficiently considering climate-related business aspects or greenwashing)
ii) MR was one of the first insurers to identify CC risks as being relevant for the insurance industry For nearly four decades, Munich Re has been monitoring and analyzing these risks in cooperation with experts in all relevant areas of science worldwide (eg cooperation with relevant experts and academ-ic/other institutions, exchanges on CC-related topics, participation in international conferences on CC-related topics, contributions to relevant publications)
Internally, Munich Re adopts a multidisciplinary approach to CC litigation, using and combining the experience and expertise of our underwriters, actuaries, claims departments and legal/science coun-sels with all areas of environmental, toxic tort and construction defect claims Munich Re is constantly monitoring the developments in climate litigation, climate-relevant legislation and other trends in that area CC is also a regular topic within our internal Emerging Risk Process (steered by Integrated Risk Management; the Emerging Risks Core Team and Emerging Risks Think Tank) Internal workshops and other events for Munich Re underwriters, claims people and risk managers regularly help to en-sure that anyone dealing with CC-related business is well informed about ongoing developments in that area
To support Munich Res cedants, a variety of workshops and conferences for clients complement Mu-nich Res publications on these issues Published conference transcripts (eg 13th International Liabil-ity Forum in 2009) and regular reports on ongoing relevant developments at the Annual Liability Regimes Conference and other market events make this information available to a wider audience among our clients Besides this, several Munich Re experts are members of the Geneva Associations Climate Risk and Insurance working group, which monitors CC-connected risks and publishes regu-larly on these issues
Munich Re's activities in the CC context aim to raise awareness of CC-related risks within and outside the insurance industry, sharing our expertise and enabling insurers and insureds to react to these challenges appropriately, both in the short term (eg considering these aspects in policy wordings) and in the long term (eg developing new products, exploring alternative energies) Insuring the con-sequences of CC is and will remain part of our daily business in many ways The publication Liability for climate change, as well as regularly published articles in our magazine Topics, document our approach, underlining our commitment to monitor and respond to such developments
iii) Dealing with risks caused by CC-related regulation or litigation is a part of Munich Re's ongoing re-search activities, product development, and risk management; and will continue in the future

Arbella Mutual Insurance Company," In response, the company purchases a robust catastrophe reinsurance program with a well diversified roster of financially strong reinsurance companies to reduce its net exposure to severe weather events to an acceptable level of capital  In recognition of the more recent trend of an increase in frequency, the company also purchases reinsurance to limit its exposure to an aggregation of losses from multiple events in a single year  Over the past few years, management has increased the limits of its reinsurance program to provide coverage for return periods well in excess of the 1-in-100 year period to ensure capital adequacy for the highest severity possible outcomes  Our robust reinsurance program and growth in our capital was recognized by AM Best in October 2020 when they upgraded our rating from A- to A Stable     

To manage catastrophe exposure, underwriters utilize mapping software to verify the location of individual exposures  Coastal exposure growth is monitored on a quarterly basis and restricted coastal zones have been identified with targeted exposure levels and specific underwriting criteria/guidelines  Various windstorm and other deductibles are in place depending on location/distance from the coast to further mitigate exposure to severe weather

Kaiser Foundation Plan of Washington," SASB also noted that an increase in the frequency of extreme weather events has the potential to impact costs and liabilities by generating additional covered medical expenses and that the associated risks could lead to an increased cost of capital Higher incidence of disease could negatively affect both clinical and non-clinical staff availability, resulting in higher expenditures on sick leave and backfilling The financial implications of these health-related impacts are difficult to quantify Changes in physical climate may also affect the efficiency of our facility operations, including increased power and water consumption necessary to maintain the indoor environment of our hospitals and patient care buildings
According to the US Global Change Research Programs published 2016 scientific assessment of the impacts of climate change on human health in the United States:
Current and future climate impacts expose more people in more places to public health threats Already in the United States, we have observed climate-related increases in our exposure to elevated temperatures; more frequent, severe, or longer-lasting extreme events; degraded air quality; diseases transmitted through food, water, and disease vectors (such as ticks and mosquitoes); and stresses to our mental health and well-being Almost all of these threats are expected to worsen with continued climate change Some of these health threats will occur over longer time periods, or at unprecedented times of the year; some people will be exposed to threats not previously experienced in their locations Overall, instances of potentially beneficial health impacts of climate change are limited in number and pertain to specific regions or populations For example, the reduction in cold-related deaths is projected to be smaller than the increase in heat-related deaths in most regions Every American is vulnerable to the health impacts associated with climate change Increased exposure to multiple health threats, together with changes in sensitivity and the ability to adapt to those threats, increases a persons vulnerability to climate-related health effects The impacts of climate change on human health interact with underlying health, demographic, and socioeconomic factors Through the combined influence of these factors, climate change exacerbates some existing health threats and creates new public health challenges While all Americans are at risk, some populations are disproportionately vulnerable, including those with low income, some communities of color, immigrant groups (including those with limited English proficiency), Indigenous peoples, children and pregnant women, older adults, vulnerable occupational groups, persons with disabilities, and persons with preexisting or chronic medical conditions
In the April 4, 2013 edition of the New England Journal of Medicine, McMichael identifies three categories of climate-change risks to health, along with their causal pathway:
1	Primary: Direct biologic consequences of heat waves, extreme weather events, and temperature-enhanced levels of urban air pollutants;
2	Secondary: Risks mediated by changes in biophysically and ecologically based processes and systems, particularly food yields, water flows, infectious-disease vectors, and (for zoonotic diseases) intermediate-host ecology; and
3	Tertiary: More diffuse effects (eg, mental health problems in failing farm communities, displaced groups, disadvantaged indigenous and minority ethnic groups); consequences of tension and conflict owing to climate changerelated declines in basic resources (water, food, timber, living space)
With regard to primary risks, climate change directly impacts the populations in all geographical areas that KP serves While all regions in which KP operates are at risk of illnesses and loss of life due to extreme temperatures, the specific risk exposures may vary For example, while the Northern and Southern California regions are particularly affected by droughts, wildfires and heat waves, the Mid-Atlantic States and Georgia are more prone to severe storms and storm surges Hawaii and the Pacific Northwest are relatively more exposed to coastal flooding as well as heat waves In general, global warming can aggravate the effects of pre-existing health conditions such as chronic respiratory disease and asthma, due to increases in air pollutants and aeroallergens There is evidence of declining air quality in cities since greater heat can also worsen air pollution such as ground-level ozone or smog According to the National Center for Health Statistics, overall current asthma prevalence among adults increased from 20012002 (71%) to 20132014 (92%) By weight status, prevalence increased among overweight adults but not among adults in the obese or normal weight categories
With regard to secondary risks, climate-related disturbances in ecological systems, such as changes in the range of infective parasites, can increase the incidence of serious infectious diseases The tick that carries Lyme Disease is reported in 457% of US counties, up from 30% in 1998  Other secondary health effects of global warming include water- and food-borne diseases Warm temperatures also increase water pollution which harms human health In rural areas, increased food insecurity can occur due to geographical shifts in optimum growing conditions and decreases in crop yields; reduced water resources for agriculture and for human consumption; and loss of property such as cropland because of floods, droughts and a rise in sea level
With regard to tertiary risks, according to The Medical Society Consortium on Climate and Health: Many people exposed to the worst extreme weather events experience stress and serious mental health consequences including depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and increases in suicidal thoughts and behavior Such disasters are also associated with increases in alcohol or drug abuse Children may also experience prolonged separation from their parents Beyond the well-known risks specific disasters pose to our mental health, the physical, social, and economic stresses created by climate change all increase our risk of mental health problems

HumanaDental Insurance Company,"  Humana is committed to integrating ""green"" building principles into our existing and new portfolio of facilities with a focus on energy and water efficiency Humana advanced this objective through the integration of climate and sustainability factors such as energy efficiency projects at our facilities, access to transportation, ENERGY STAR or LEED ranking, associate engagement (ie, behavioral change) and other parameters, into the decision criteria used to improve our facility portfolio and select future Humana locations  Opportunities for improving the portfolio and achieving energy and GHG reduction goals are identified by the Workplace Solutions team in collaboration with our external consulting partners  Initiatives may be evaluated and presented to the CSR Council for support and funding including capital investment, associate involvement (ie, resource support) or other requirements  The CSR Council reviews programmatic initiatives in contribution to the overall business strategy with CSR Stewards
The most important components of the short term strategy (defined as less than 3 years) include the pursuit of Humana's energy efficiency, GHG emissions, and cost reduction goals The development and issuance of these goals has refined the operational practices by which Humana operates its facilities and direct operations It has spurred direct investment in resources, both financial and personnel, to focus on climate change mitigation within our owned facilities Humana committed to investing over $10 million towards efficiency projects in order to achieve their 10% reduction targets around energy and GHG emissions from a 2009 baseline for its owned property portfolio   These investments included projects such as performing building upgrades to ensure that energy is being used as efficiently as possible at Humana's facilities, upgrades to HVAC, lighting, and the installation of vending misers which have all resulted in steps forward in Humana's achievement of our reduction targets  These efforts not only drive energy cost and emissions reductions, but illustrate to our associates, customers, and other key stakeholders our commitment to mitigating GHG emissions and sustainability
Our long term investment strategy (generally considered to be 5-10 years) is impacted by potential consequences of climate change such as regulation, natural resource scarcity, facility operational costs or even human health impacts Our CSR Stewards team reviews short and long term trends and impacts associated with sustainability and refines our business strategy accordingly For example, Humana's portfolio includes both owned and leased assets Many of our facility investments whether directly owned or property leases are on a long term basis (up to 10 years) As such, Humana has developed a sustainable real estate approach to ensure direct facility investments or those by way of leased assets considers the long-term impacts of building characteristics on employee wellness, operational costs and environmental impact  Additionally, as our business transitions from traditional healthcare insurance to an integrated care model, our footprint of facilities over time will include new facility types such as medical clinics  As such our long-term strategy must also account for this change

"Bravo Health Mid-Atlantic, Inc."," Additionally, increases in energy and fuel costs may result in broader inflationary pressures from our suppliers 

We manage risks associated with energy and fuel costs through (1) our emissions reduction projects and (2) our tracking and monitoring on progress toward energy reduction targets    Our Global Real Estate (GRE) team considers this potential risk to inform decision on making on investments in emissions reduction projects In 2016, we completed a series of emissions reduction projects, which include lighting retrofits and enhancements to building automation systems   We also manage this risk towards our emphasis on fleet efficiency - Cigna's vehicle fleet exceeds the national average fuel efficiencythe majority of our vehicles are 4-cylinder with alternative fuel (E85) capabilities and hybrid engines, and are classified as partial zero emissions vehicles    To manage progress against our 2017 emissions reduction targets, we utilize a proprietary technology data management portal and Utility Insight; a tool to aggregate data for all the sustainability program efforts The Utility tool provides a detailed dashboard of energy cost, consumption and variance across our real estate portfolio  in addition to ENERGY STAR® ratings        In 2016, Cigna had 45 sites enrolled in the US Environmental Protection Agencys ENERGY STAR® program  These management methods have not reduced the likelihood of this risk, but they have reduced this risks potential magnitude over the next five years

As an insurance organization, estimating risk is fundamental to Farmers operations  Such risks include carbon emission, operational risk and other climate related risk  We recognize climate change can have a potential financial impact on our operation  We continue to evaluate opportunities to operate facilities more efficiently and decrease our carbon emissions

Changes to the frequency and severity of natural catastrophes, especially hurricanes, pose risk to our business  Farmers uses both internal and external catastrophe models to make its best assessment of prospective catastrophe risk for pricing purposes, subject to regulatory requirements  Our modeling work generates outputs on a deterministic and probabilistic basis which we use to manage our enterprise view of risk

While the modeling data and outputs continue to improve over time, there is still uncertainty around the outputs  Farmers considers this uncertainty in our selection and pricing of risk, and our overall tolerance of catastrophe exposure

Victoria Specialty Insurance Company,"S  Nationwide Mutual and its subsidiaries write personal, agribusiness and main-street commercial property casualty insurance, as well as life insurance and retirement solution products  
Nationwide stays abreast of the most recent scientific studies and findings with regard to climate change  Currently, the consensus opinion by the scientific community on observed trends is that tropical cyclones, extropical cyclones (winter storms), and severe thunderstorms will increase in intensity while decreasing in frequency due to climate change  Wildfires and floods are expected to increase in both intensity and frequency
The Nationwide companies face several potential business risks associated with climate change including:
	Potential volatility in results due to possible increased frequency and/or severity of weather-related catastrophic losses; 
	Regulatory constraints on charging appropriate rates that take into account possible weather changes and related losses that are not reflected by historical statistics;
	Market share of business being adversely impacted due to a disproportionate growth of population and property along coastal areas;
	Catastrophic losses not limited to coastal areas potentially becoming more frequent (as in hurricane-related losses in the Midwest); 
	Disparate impact of climate change on certain insured segments either directly such as agriculture or through regulation (eg heavy industry due to emissions)  These insured segments could be significantly impacted which could in turn affect the companys business; and
	Availability and cost of risk transfer options (Reinsurance, Cat Bonds, Cat Swaps, etc) 

As we go to market with different initiatives, geographic diversification is one of the factors taken into consideration  Additionally, Nationwide maintains sizable investment portfolios which might be impacted by climate change  Therefore, consideration is given to the potential impacts of climate change on the investment portfolio 
As many of these risks cross boundaries, the risk assessment needs to consider the correlation of the risk across the entire enterprise

Insurance Departments allow, in Actuarial Rate indications For other than hurricane 
weather exposure, we rely on a combination of company and industry data  The

Swiss Re LIfe & Health America Inc," Understanding the implications of climate change is important to the company and is a key component of our business and long-term risk management strategy We therefore actively promote and engage in research on climate related risks and incorporate key findings into our risk management processes This knowledge informs our business decisions and supports the development of innovative insurance solutions to mitigate or adapt to climate change and severe weather impacts To foster greater risk awareness of climate change, we engage in dialogue with governments, corporations, civil society and other stakeholders, in addition to taking measures to reduce our own carbon footprint For example in March 2012 Swiss Re took part in a US Senate press event to support calls for Congress to restart their discussion on measures to tackle climate change 

Swiss Re systematically assesses climate related risk (physical, regulatory, reputation, etc) as part of our risk management and underwriting process Risks such as potential losses from climate litigation in the US are monitored on a quarterly basis  The company supplements risk assessment with research into climate change and its economic impact This process is led by three units: Sustainability & Political Risk Management, Catastrophe Perils, and Emerging Risk Management More details on these units can be found in question 3 

Swiss Re also invests considerable resources to explore how the future risk landscape as well as how related business opportunities may develop For example, in January 2013 the company released a report which assessed the potential growth of investment in renewable energies under different economic and political scenarios The report found that, depending on different scenarios, 34-92% of global power supply could be met with low-carbon energies by 2050 The conclusion drawn from the report was that the expected large growth in the renewable energy sector would be accompanied by a corresponding large requirement for risk management and risk transfer products and services See ""Building a sustainable energy future: risks and opportunities"": http://mediaswissrecom/documents/Scenarios_for_Climate_Changepdf

Key climate change impacts Guardian anticipates include:  increased energy costs, impacts to the health and well-being of our staff and policy holders caused by changing weather patterns, severe weather impacts on our business, staff, and policy holders  

Among the key risks Guardian continues to focus on impacts of the following climate change issues:
	Hotter summers and drought conditions in large portion of the country present significant health risks Without measures to reduce the risk, there could be higher premature deaths per year for people vulnerable to hotter weather
	Increasing pressure on water resources Without action to improve water resources, there could be major supply shortages in some parts of country and cause water supply shortages  Guardian has improved our facilities to be more resilient to such challenges with water conservation initiatives throughout our sites (eg, installation of sensor-based bathroom facilities, the manner in which we cool our data centers and workspaces to reduce reliance on water, etc)
	The risks of severe storms, tornadoes, flooding are projected to increase  Guardian maintains business continuity plans for all business areas as well as sales/field offices (including those more prone to such severe weather) to ensure we are able to continue to service our customers   Without plans, the effects of climate change and population growth could increase the likelihood of severe weather than could potentially cause damage to buildings, property, and people  The number of days a year with higher than normal temperatures have increased and is expected to continue This could mean greater demand for energy to cool buildings and more heat related illnesses  Therefore, increasing costs and raising premiums The severity of this past winter illustrated the need to provide greater remote access to staff is only increasing, further supporting greater work force diversity
	Increases in drought and some pest infestation could reduce the air quality and increase diseases  Projected drought conditions could mean more pests and diseases, which thrive in warmer conditions, which may also pose an increasing threat to communities and may even result in some deaths 
	Milder winters may result in a major reduction in cold-related deaths and illnesses A reduction in cold-related deaths due to increasing average winter temperatures will benefit vulnerable groups, including those with existing health problems This will mean longer life expectancy which affects our risk models 
	Harsher winters may result in a significant increase in cold and flu-related deaths and illnesses Currently, cold weather results in some number of premature deaths each year due to snow/ice removal and/or related accidents  Lower winter temperatures could increase cold-related deaths as well as the number of accidents that result in permanent injury  This could result in higher payouts on claims
	Higher energy costs will require that we adapt our strategy, operations, reporting, and compliance efforts to meet these conditions 
	Sound carbon management strategies, Guardian has adapted programs such as paper/print reduction and recycling, equipment maintenance and eco-friendly upgrades, water and power conservation, increase fuel economy with reduced consumption, reduction in wasteful packaging which enhances our brand value while improving operational efficiency and provides returns on our investments Therefore, at Guardian greenhouse reductions are both possible and economically feasible
	Increased pollution is likely to have an impact on respiratory health of Guardian staff and policyholders  In consideration of this and in an effort to reduce emissions, we continue to expand our tele-commuting solutions for our staff and reduce our requirements for other emission producing needs (eg, reduced mail delivery, reduced printing, etc)

Climate Change Impact on Market Demand
Changes in temperature and weather patterns across the US and the world have the ability to influence disease vectors and the spread of infectious diseases as well as the frequency and the severity of chronic illnesses  If this were to happen, it could lead to increased incidences of chronic illnesses and in the type of clinical services Humana will need to offer its members For example, the 2014 National Climate Assessment shows that climate change is increasing health risk such as: respiratory stress from poor air quality, heat stress, the spread of food-borne, insect-born, and waterborne diseases  Extreme weather events impact vulnerable populations, often leading to fatalities

If Humana did not prepare for changes in physical climate, it is possible that Humana could suffer a loss in market share due to lack of readiness as well as increased operational costs associated with more health-related claims being filed   It is difficult to assess the financial impacts of these risks given the complexity of climate change and population health, however we do not currently anticipate substantial bottom line impacts

Senior level management will review pertinent information and have the ultimate authority to recommend changes in services offered and cost structures related to shifts in claims filed, or other company procedures in order to reduce impacts from these changes in customer claims and health trends related to changes in climate  The results of our partner dialogues and regional trending will inform future decisions around services offered to mitigate these impacts

First Specialty Insurance Corporation,"swissrecom/rethinking/sustainable_energy/our_position_and_objectiveshtml) The governance process of the company's climate change activities includes various Group Executive Committee members and an annual presentation on Swiss Re's climate change strategy and activities is made to the Board of Director's Chairman's and Governance Committee  On a day-to-day basis the topic is managed by the Head Group Sustainability Risk  The Head Group Sustainability Risk and his team are responsible for implementing Swiss Re's climate change strategy and for coordinating the associated activities, and are the central point of communication for all climate-related inquiries from within and outside the company

Climate-related risks are systematically assessed during risk and underwriting process Priority is given to factors that could have the largest or most immediate financial impact, supplemented by research into climate change and its impacts Various units contribute to the assessment, including Group Sustainability Risk, which coordinates Swiss Re's climate change response Emerging Risk Management identifies and assesses new or emerging risks, including those climate related Catastrophe Perils unit designs and maintains loss models and supports the assessment of climate related risks as part of the underwriting process 

Swiss Re's property and casualty business is written using the four-eye principle: transactions must be approved by at least two authorized individuals  with the exception of single risk acceptances, which can be authorized by one underwriter, with the four-eye principle taken care of by spot checks after acceptance Each underwriter is assigned an individual underwriting authority based on technical skills and experience; any business exceeding this authority triggers a well-defined escalation process

Large individual transactions that could materially affect the Group's and Business Units risk exposure require independent review and sign-off by Risk Management before they can be authorized This is part of our three signature approval process (involving Swiss Re's underwriting, client management and risk management functions) that establishes the accountability of each of the parties for significant transactions We monitor accumulated exposure to single risks or to an underlying risk factor on a Group-wide basis We further manage our risk by external retrocession, risk swaps, or by transferring risk to capital markets through insurance-linked securities

Priorities are determined by the potential impact of risks Risks include any change that could have a short or long term negative impact on our business (eg the financial impact of insured losses) or alter our understanding of that risk  The risk assessment process described above is aimed at protecting Swiss Re's capital base by avoiding the acceptance of too much business that is exposed to the impacts of severe weather or other potential loss factors Another priority is potential reputation risk if business were accepted that included unacceptable practices relating to general environmental operating practices Swiss Re introduced its Sustainability Risk Framework process to minimize this kind of potential reputation risk

Swiss Re is committed to invest its assets in a responsible manner which is reflected by the integration of environmental, social and governance (""ESG"") criteria in our investment process To that end, roles and responsibilities of the different investment units with respect to responsible investing activities have been defined, in particular for the integration of ESG considerations in the investment process
The key document with regard to responsible investment and ESG considerations, including climate change is the Responsible Investment Policy This policy is a Group policy issued by the Group Chief Investment Officer that outlines the ESG business policy and approach to sustainability in the management of Swiss Re Group's investment assets This document describes the Responsible Investment Framework, Principles and corresponding roles and responsibilities of the different investment units and stakeholders involved in the management of Swiss Re Group's investment assets

Swiss Re's investment activities are also subject to the company's Sustainability Risk Framework (http://mediaswissrecom/documents/2015_corporate_responsibility_report_swissre_crr15pdf , see p 26) This framework consists of country and company exclusions, as well as eight policies on sensitive topics like oil and gas, mining, and an overarching environmental protection policy Each policy contains a number of predefined criteria and qualitative standards that may lead to the exclusion of a company or a country from our investment scope

The overall responsibility to monitor our commitment to responsible investment lies with the Group Chief Investment Officer, who is advised by the Asset Management Executive Team and the Asset Management Investment Committee Furthermore, an ESG Advisory Group formed by representatives of all investment units, legal, compliance and risk management, oversees and monitors the progress of Swiss Re's responsible investment activities, and ensures that our commitment is reflected in our day-to-day activities 

In 2007 we signed the UN Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI) and in 2012 the Principles for Sustainable Insurance (PSI), thereby formally endorsing our commitment to corporate responsibility The PRI and PSI are taken into account in Swiss Re's comprehensive responsible investment framework As a PRI signatory we provide in-depth reporting on our responsible investment activities The report is available on the PRI website at https://wwwunpriorg/organisation/swiss-re-ltd-143707

Direct General Life Insurance Company," We have established a Risk Management Committee (RMC) with top-level executives, who on behalf of the Board of Directors oversee the implementation and development of the ERM program The RMC is chaired by National General Holding Corps Chief Risk Officer, who oversees identification, measurement, aggregation and management of key risk exposures around the organization, including risks related to climate change and/or severe weather 
Risks identified by our ERM program are defined by five broad risk categories: underwriting risk, market risk, credit risk, operational risk and strategic risk We have established several risk appetite and tolerance statements around each of these five broad risk categories Potential losses from weather-related events are included within underwriting risk and are closely monitored on a quarterly basis Additionally, we have established a risk appetite and tolerance statement specifically addressing the potential modeled losses due to weather-related events based on commercially available catastrophe models
We are keenly aware of the potential risk associated with natural disasters affecting our operations; therefore, we have in place a business continuity and disaster recovery plan to manage any potential outage or office shut-down due to severe weather

Stonebridge Life Insurance Company,"  Yes  As noted in the response to question 3 regarding the indirect impact climate change has on the Companys business through the investment portfolio, Aegon expanded on these opportunities in the CDP submission under three headings:

A	 Opportunities that are driven by changes in regulation

General environmental regulations, including planning-The Real Estate Alternatives Portfolio (""REAP"") program in the United States has made investments in sustainable strategies in both real estate and natural resources: 
 In real estate, the REAP funds are invested in several partnerships that are developing office buildings to US Green Building Council Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification standards   
 REAP continues to maintain a sizeable timberland (a renewable natural resource) interest, having invested approximately $85 million (private equity funds that exclusively invest in timber and timberlands) since 2002  Aegon USA continues to maintain a large wind generation investment that totals US$150 million parceled among four projects  These projects generate enough electricity to power approximately 85,000 homes They do so with zero greenhouse gas emissions  The same amount of electricity generated from conventional fossil fuel plants would have resulted in the emission of over 500,000 tons of CO2, 25 tons of SO2 and 1,081 tons of nitrous oxides per year  In 2013, the Community Investments team once again closed on a number of low income housing tax credit investments that feature noteworthy energy efficiency and other green design elements-Invest-ment opportune-ities-Unknown-Direct-Likely-Low-medium-	The returns on investments in some areas like wind energy and timberland can be affected by the availability of tax credits and state incentives to invest They continue to show an attractive return for us and at the same time allow us to make an environmental or social impact We continue to grow our impact investment portfolio-Our responsible investment team continues to monitor opportunities in the impact investing area The process for monitoring opportunities in this area is already in place so there is no additional cost to the business

Renewable energy regulation-Impact investing is an emerging approach within the asset management sector: making investments that deliver not only sound financial returns, but also a real social or environmental benefit Currently, Aegon has a portfolio of EUR30 billion invested in projects ranging from low-cost housing to sustainable timber and renewable energy In the Netherlands, Aegon continues to work with an energy provider to offer internet savings account called Eneco BronSparen that was developed with a local utility provider for their clients Eneco BronSparen invests in sustainable energy projects 40% of the savings are invested in sustainable companies in the energy sectorIncreased demand for existing products/services-Unknown-Direct-About as likely as not-Low-Impact investing is an emerging area that we continue to monitor for future opportunities As governments continue to stimulate the green economy we believe there will be more attractive investment opportunities for us  We will continue to work with companies such as the energy company mentioned in the example to broaden our distribution channel and seek opportunities in the market place for environmentally friendly products and services Impact investing opportunities are monitored by our responsible investment team Opportunities for developing new products and distributing them are managed by our marketing and product development departmentsThe process for monitoring opportunities in this area is  already in place so there is no additional cost to the business

B opportunities that are driven by changes in physical climate parameters
Other physical climate opportunities-Climate change has created opportunities for companies to develop new products and move into new markets thus opening up opportunities for future growth-Investment opportunities-Unknown-Direct-More likely than not	Low-medium-The development of new products to address opportunities resulting from climate change will positively impact the investment potential for some companies therefore providing greater returns for our company and our clients Our responsible investment teams continue to monitor developments in this area Within our Aegon Asset Management we have a new asset committee that looks at new opportunities for us to invest in	The process for monitoring opportunities in this area are already in place so there is no additional cost to the business

C Opportunities that are driven by changes in other climate-related developments

Other drivers-The Real Estate Alternatives Portfolio (""REAP"") program in the United States has made investments in sustainable strategies in both real estate and natural resources: 
 In real estate, the REAP funds are invested in several partnerships that are developing office buildings to US Green Building Council Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification standards

Standard Security Life Insurance Company of New York," The company does not market P&C products  Accordingly, the company has not addressed climate change with its policyholders",5
American Standard Insurance Company of Wisconsin," This includes providing customers with informational newsletters and brochures related to loss reduction For example, we provide brochures that outline how to reduce wildfire risk We also offer discounts in many states for customers that have impact-resistant roof materials Loss control services are available for commercial and farm/ranch accounts Flood coverage is available through our agents via the National Flood Insurance Program 
Futhermore, American Family is a member of the Insurance Institute for Business & Home Safety (IBHS) The following text, prepared by IBHS, is a brief description of the Institute and some of its activities that relate to the issue of climate change
IBHS is a 501(c)(3) organization, wholly supported by the property (re)insurance industry, which conducts objective, scientific research to identify and promote effective actions that strengthen homes, businesses, and communities against natural disasters and other causes of loss IBHS does this by identifying and advocating improved property design, construction, retrofitting, maintenance, repair, and preparation practices IBHS guidance for mitigating property losses is available directly to the public and to our members/policyholders, at wwwdisastersafetyorg, and through social media (eg, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, YouTube and Vimeo)
IBHS advocates the concept of going green and building strong recognizing that addressing climate change involves both reducing greenhouse gas emissions and adapting homes, businesses, and communities to severe weather that may result from climate change:
 As an insurance-supported organization, IBHS recognizes that climate change strategies must do more than build structures to be energy efficient They must be built to modern fire protection standards to help resist fire and avoid the water/chemical deluge needed for fire suppression; they should be strong enough to avoid wind destruction and resulting relocation in landfills; and properties should be sited and elevated in a manner that protects against flooding and environmental degradation from landslides All of these are part of going green
 IBHS also firmly believes that adaptation is critical, not only to reduce long-term property insurance losses, but to buttress individual and societal resilience All of the property protection measures that IBHS advocates to strengthen structures against current weather threats will also reduce future losses caused by climate change events And, the unprecedented scientific research conducted at the unique IBHS Research Center is critical to identification of new mitigation actions that may help protect against more severe weather events
 Additionally, research conducted by IBHS will help to make sure that green building enhancements do not inadvertently cause structures to be less disaster-resistant, or even worse, threaten the life safety of occupants or first respondersfor example, photovoltaic arrays that take flight or pose fire suppression challenges are the antithesis of building strong

Amerigroup Community Care of New Mexico,"  The current target is a 30% reduction per square foot in Scope I and II emissions by the year 2020  This reduction target is based on 2013 levels

Anthem is also able to maintain lower levels of Scope III emissions as a result of a comprehensive Work at Home program  Currently over 30% of the 55,000 person workforce participates in the program, which ultimately reduces or eliminates commuter miles

To meet Scope I and II reduction targets Anthem has taken multiple, strategic level steps including:
	All self-managed and owned locations are benchmarked using the EPAs ENERGY STAR portfolio manager  As of July 2015, over 25% of offices and data centers have earned ENERGY STAR certification  Anthem has a target of certifying 50% of the entire building portfolio by the year 2020
	Invested in facility upgrades and controls technology  Examples include ultrasonic humidification for primary data centers, smart lighting controls for offices, and variable frequency drives for HVAC motors
	Conducted ASHRAE level II/III energy audits for all self-managed and owned locations as a means of optimizing operational efficiency

American Standard Insurance Company of Wisconsin," One recent example would be our free tornado alert service, which allows policyholders to sign up to receive a call in case of severe weather in their area As discussed in question 6, the company supports organizations such as Institute for Business and Home Safety (IBHS) as a way to promote better understanding of home and business safety and sustainability 
We actively lobby within industry organizations for the use of fortified construction standards in new home construction We actively promote and educate consumers regarding the use of class 3 and 4 impact resistant roofing material We provide a discount to customers having class 3 and 4 roofing material We also waive the deductible up to $2,500 for customers with a wood roof who have sustained a loss and replace their wood roof with class 3 or 4 impact resistant roofing 
American Family has the capability of finding latitude and longitude for a given property policy We are using this in a number of ways An example of how our Personal Lines area uses this technology is tracking exposure with risk of wild fires and floods Our Claims area uses mapping when working with catastrophes A map can be created showing the location of our risks and the location of reported losses If an area is severely devastated, we can use our location information to locate specific risks and deploy claims adjusters 

We also have the ability to establish on site mobile catastrophe command centers in multiple locations across the country using one of our six catastrophe vehicles The satellite technology in our vehicles allows us to tap into the companys computer and phone system, making the vehicle a truly mobile claim office Our vehicles contain workstations for meeting with customers and settling claims on the spot In communities where tornados have destroyed homes, people need a place to meet with adjusters, and they often meet right in the vehicle

Horace Mann Property and Casualty Insurance,"  If an increase in weather events and/or wildfires were to occur, in addition to the attendant increase in claim costs, which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition, concentrations of insurance risk could impact our ability to make homeowners insurance available to our customers  This could adversely impact our volume of business and our results of operations or cash flows  The potential for new laws and regulations associated with climate change or associated with trying to anticipate potential issues linked directly or indirectly to climate change also could have an adverse impact on our cost of doing business, our results of operations or cash flows, and by extension, the ultimate cost of our insurance products

The Company has processes in place to regularly monitor our exposure distribution  We monitor the percent of our exposures that we consider coastal and we also evaluate exposure concentrations in non-coastal areas, to ensure an acceptable distribution of risk  We evaluate our catastrophe losses monthly  We review catastrophe modeling results on our book of business twice annually  The modeling results are generated using AIR software for both near term and long term event frequency

Massachusetts Mutual Life insurance Company," The company views the risk to specific operations to be minimal with primary operating centers in Massachusetts and Arizona As discussed in questions 2 and 5, this risk is considered as part of the companys analysis on current and potential investments",3
American Mercury Insurance Company,"  Those regulations, however, do not allow insurers to consider the impact of climate change, so Mercurys rates will be inadequate to the extent that future fires or storms are more frequent and/or more severe than what exists in our historic data  Although the company cannot add the cost of reinsurance to our rates in California, we have purchased reinsurance coverage for our California business, and as the effects of climate change cause more frequent or more severe catastrophic events, the cost of catastrophe reinsurance coverage will rise  
Because our view of wildfire risk has evolved, we now have moratoriums in place around the state of California, in areas where we feel our aggregate exposure has become too high  Even if rates were adequate to pay for expected loss costs and to cover our net cost of reinsurance, we would still have to manage our aggregate exposure to loss in order to survive the very largest events
In areas where our wildfire exposure is over concentrated, we are considering non-renewals to reduce our aggregate exposure in specific areas that have been identified by wildfire models
We have licensed the AIR Worldwide Touchstone family of models so that we can do more extensive modeling and analysis of wildfire, earthquake and fire following earthquake, hurricane and such analyses In addition to wildfire Mercury faces climate change risk related to increases in hurricane frequency and severity  Because of the predicted increase in hurricane frequency, Mercury is taking numerous steps to monitor, control or even reduce exposure to catastrophic losses caused by hurricanes  We have purchased a catastrophe reinsurance treaty to help manage the exposure to hurricanes and other weather-related disasters  We revise our rates to take exposure to weather-related events into account  We model exposure to weather-related events at least annually to help manage our exposure  And, if aggregate exposure gets too large, we implement restrictions to slow the growth in exposure to acceptable levels  These exposure management plans are reviewed by senior management   
The companys business continuity and disaster preparedness plans do contemplate hurricanes and other windstorm as potential threats to operations  To the extent that the frequency and severity of such events may be affected by climate change, they will be incorporated into the business continuity plan 
All of the factors above and below are considered within the companys enterprise risk management structure, ultimately reporting to the board of directors, but the company does not have a dedicated point-person or team specifically focused on climate change strategies  The company does not have a climate change policy with respect to investments and has not issued a public statement on its climate policy

Ohio Farmers Insurance Company,"  We use multiple catastrophe models to develop loss estimates for the perils of hurricane, earthquake, severe convective storm and winter storm  Our portfolio is modeled using several hurricane event sets within each model to estimate losses from a variety of different views of hurricane risk  In addition to the standard set of modeled output, Westfield blends the modeled results to reflect a view of risk unique to our exposure  Modeled loss estimates are subject to uncertainty and represent only one method of estimating loss  We recognize that the loss probabilities generated by the models are not predictive of future natural catastrophes and that they only provide estimates of the magnitude of losses that may occur in the event of such catastrophes  

Tools and methods that are independent of modeled results include the following: analysis of trends in historical catastrophe loss; deterministic scenario analyses; case studies; and quantification of non-modeled perils and exposures  Long-term demographic, sociological, and climate trends are also considered  The knowledge gained through these activities provides valuable insight that is used to help form our strategies related to catastrophe exposure management, capital deployment, reinsurance, coverage, and pricing",7

Kaiser Foundation Plan of Washington,"
One way that KP may be able to regularly reassess climate change related risks over time is through health research carried out by the organization In 2005, Kaiser Permanente launched a program aimed at building one of the largest and most comprehensive resources in the United States for research on the influence of both inherited and environmental factors on peoples health The databank created through this program, now called the Kaiser Permanente Research Bank, has the ambitious goal of recruiting 500,000 Kaiser Permanente adult members to share health information and a small blood sample for research As of May 2019, the Research Bank is more than halfway toward its goal The Research Bank is already paying dividends in scientific studies that are examining the role of genes and environment in conditions as varied as diabetes, cancer, bipolar disorder, heart disease, asthma, glaucoma, multiple sclerosis, and migraine  among many others DNA samples are used to produce genotypic markers on the whole genomes of Research Bank participants, making it possible to study the role of genes in many different diseases and conditions KP investigators and collaborating scientists can conduct research to understand genetic and environmental influences  including weather and climate influences  on disease susceptibility, the course of disease, and response to treatment; as well as to translate these findings into improvements in medical care and public health By studying data pulled from Kaiser Permanente Research Bank participants' health surveys, electronic health records and DNA samples, researchers are now looking for new ways to diagnose, treat and prevent certain diseases

American National Insurance Company,"

When considering individual investments as well as the aggregate amount of investment categories the Companies consider risks beyond the traditional investing frameworks of credit worthiness and growth potential A holistic approach to investment risk considers political, macroeconomic, environmental and potential correlations with other risks the Companies accept For example, climate risk is often associated with underwriting risks that the Companies manage with geographic concentration analysis and reinsurance A large loss may impact the Companies underwriting results, reinsurance collectability, the credit quality of a reinsurers bonds and the value of the reinsurers equity Similarly, societal initiatives to reduce carbon emission may impact private or municipally owned electric utilities as well as global demand for fossil fuels which may impact asset values

The potential for climate change risk impacting the portfolio is addressed holistically and not isolated to a particular investment type  Accordingly, all of the Companies risk monitoring beginning with asset allocation through individual asset purchase limits assists with monitoring each individual risk

The Companies also believe that the Efficient Markets Hypothesis, which holds that all known risks are discounted in the current price of an asset, adequately discounts risks such as climate change by the pricing mechanism inherent within capital markets  Risks such as climate change are discounted within the price of an individual asset

REGENCE BLUESHIELD," However, Regence BlueSheild does have a formal sustainability program that seeks to incorporate the triple bottom line framework (economic growth, environmental stewardship, and social equity) into its planning, decision-making, and operations The sustainability program includes efforts to incorporate greater environmental stewardship into company operations Working with Regence BlueSheilds Real Estate and Facilities department, Information Technology (IT), and Human Resources, Regence BlueSheild has undertaken the following efforts that will result in reduced greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions:

	Information Technology (IT): There are several efforts within Regence BlueSheilds IT infrastructure where technology and date center infrastructure changes have resulted in efficiencies directed at power, cooling, and space:
o	Major cooling upgrade to Salt Lake City data center
o	Switch to more efficient servers
o	Server virtualization
o	Mainframe consolidation
o	Increased data storage efficiencies
o	Replace firewall infrastructure with a more energy-efficient system
o	Replaced load balancer infrastructure with a more energy-efficient system
o	Upgraded our call center telephone system
o	Recycle eWaste though a BAN-certified eCyclerShift to print on demand and double-sided paper
	Real Estate and Facilities:
o	Replaced aging HVAC system (boilers and chillers) with more energy efficient system
o	Established standardized HVAC temperature set points, to maximize unit efficiencies, which reduced energy consumption
o	Implemented daylight harvesting in Burlington, and implementing in locations when remodels occur
o	Changed lighting in Salem garage from sodium vapor to fluorescent
o	Received Energy Star certification in 2 locations (Burlington and Tacoma), tracking energy use in all locations through Energy Star
o	Contracting with a janitorial vendor that uses proprietary green cleaners and microfiber towels
o	Renovating and maintaining our office space through use of low VOC paints and carpets, purchasing products with recycled content, reusing materials and furniture where possible, recycling materials such as carpet
o	Conducting waste audits to assess the waste stream and identify opportunities to reduce waste and increase recycling 
	Human Resources
o	Reducing our actual footprint through telework and mobile work arrangements An estimated 27% of Regence BlueSheild employees now work remotely This initiative has reduced/eliminated commutes for these employees with a commensurate reduction in emissions (We have not measured the reduced emissions or other environmental benefits of this shift to remote and mobile work) While we expect this effort to have decreased emissions, we recognized that there is some displacement of emissions to employees who are now lighting, heating, and cooling their homes during the day when they are working from home
o	Regence BlueSheild has a strong commute reimbursement program that subsidizes public transit passes and carpooling
o	Regence BlueSheild also has a strong bike commuter program that encourages employees to bike to work The bike commuter program also provides support to beginning bike commuters through a bike buddy program and various bike-commuting workshops Regence BlueSheild participates in May Bike to Work Month and the Bike Commute Challenge in September We estimate that 80 employees bike commute during the summer and 40 commute regularly by bike in the winter

Geisinger Health Plan,"  Generally, buildings are the largest consumer of energy and specifically healthcare buildings are the second most intense user of energy  Geisinger Health takes a holistic approach which is mission centric  The driving force is using less energy to reduce the pollutants generated at powerplants which will improve air quality and the health of our patients, members, and the communities we serve    

Specifically, we have reduced emissions by 250,000 tons annually   This result has also lowered our annual system energy costs by $15 million but more importantly improving health  Here is a brief listing of the initiatives achieving these reductions and efficiencies:

1	Geisinger has the most LEED Buildings of any healthcare system in Pennsylvania at 17  LEED buildings are built to higher standards of efficiency and consume less energy
2	We utilize co-generation (2 sites) to generate electricity almost 3 times more efficiently than utility power plants, since we can use the heat by-product  This alone has reduced our CO2 generation by 40,000 tons annually
3	We employ thermal storage to store heat or cooling to reduce demand on the grid and improve efficiency and resiliency
4	We maintain our buildings efficiency by performing retro-commissioning  Two years ago, we performed retro-commissioning at the Hughes Center (corporate office for our health plan) and reduced energy consumption by more than $100,000, resulting in a payback of less than one year

AMEX ASSURANCE COMPANY," However, an increasing number of business units and staff groups are considering sustainability-related opportunities and integrating their findings into their ongoing operating strategies For example, facilities and data centers have ongoing energy efficiency programs in place Because of the nature of our goods and services (payments and travel services) risks associated with climate change are currently perceived as low for American Express There are several reasons for this
American Express is primarily in the service business, so the company does not rely heavily on natural resource inputs such as water or agricultural products that are particularly sensitive to climate change That said, the company does have some climate change risk exposure in the supply chain, but at this time this risk exposure is not significant enough to elevate climate change considerations to the corporate strategy level While American Express recognizes that climate change may have an impact on certain consumption habits, our payments business is diversified across all sectors of the economy and therefore does not have significant exposure to any particular segment that may be affected  positively or negatively  by climate change Finally, although we recognize that the travel industry can be affected by climate change, no clear trends have emerged on how this relates to our travel services business in a strategic sense (ii) Whether you expect it to be in the future
As mentioned above, climate change is perceived to have little current effect on American Express business due to the nature of our services While an increasing number of business units and staff groups are considering climate change risks and opportunities and integrating their findings into their ongoing operating strategies, it is unlikely that climate change will become integrated into the overall corporate business strategy in the short term (this year or next)   However, American Express continuously monitors and evaluates the brand implications associated with appropriate environmental responsibility efforts vis-à-vis climate change and other areas of concern as well as business opportunities At some point in the future climate change considerations may become more tightly integrated with the overall corporate strategy

Kaiser Foundation Health Plan Mid Atlantic,"
The Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) concluded in 2013 that an increase in extreme weather events, coupled with the spread of infectious diseases, and food and water scarcity, are likely to present material implications for the managed care industry through an increase in covered medical expenses SASB also noted that an increase in the frequency of extreme weather events has the potential to impact costs and liabilities by generating additional covered medical expenses and that the associated risks could lead to an increased cost of capital Higher incidence of disease could negatively affect both clinical and non-clinical staff availability, resulting in higher expenditures on sick leave and backfilling The financial implications of these health-related impacts are difficult to quantify Changes in physical climate may also affect the efficiency of our facility operations, including increased power and water consumption necessary to maintain the indoor environment of our hospitals and patient care buildings
According to the US Global Change Research Programs published 2016 scientific assessment of the impacts of climate change on human health in the United States:
Current and future climate impacts expose more people in more places to public health threats Already in the United States, we have observed climate-related increases in our exposure to elevated temperatures; more frequent, severe, or longer-lasting extreme events; degraded air quality; diseases transmitted through food, water, and disease vectors (such as ticks and mosquitoes); and stresses to our mental health and well¬being Almost all of these threats are expected to worsen with continued climate change Some of these health threats will occur over longer time periods, or at unprecedented times of the year; some people will be exposed to threats not previously experienced in their locations Overall, instances of potentially beneficial health impacts of climate change are limited in number and pertain to specific regions or populations For example, the reduction in cold-related deaths is projected to be smaller than the increase in heat-related deaths in most regions Every American is vulnerable to the health impacts associated with climate change Increased exposure to multiple health threats, together with changes in sensitivity and the ability to adapt to those threats, increases a persons vulnerability to climate-related health effects The impacts of climate change on human health interact with underlying health, demographic, and socioeconomic factors Through the combined influence of these factors, climate change exacerbates some existing health threats and creates new public health challenges While all Americans are at risk, some populations are disproportionately vulnerable, including those with low income, some communities of color, immigrant groups (including those with limited English proficiency), Indigenous peoples, children and pregnant women, older adults, vulnerable occupational groups, persons with disabilities, and persons with preexisting or chronic medical conditions""In the April 4, 2013 edition of the New England Journal of Medicine, McMichael identifies three categories of climate-change risks to health, along with their causal pathway:
1	Primary: Direct biologic consequences of heat waves, extreme weather events, and temperature-enhanced levels of urban air pollutants;
2	Secondary: Risks mediated by changes in biophysically and ecologically based processes and systems, particularly food yields, water flows, infectious-disease vectors, and (for zoonotic diseases) intermediate-host ecology; and
3	Tertiary: More diffuse effects (eg, mental health problems in failing farm communities, displaced groups, disadvantaged indigenous and minority ethnic groups); consequences of tension and conflict owing to climate changerelated declines in basic resources (water, food, timber, living space)
With regard to primary risks, climate change directly impacts the populations in all geographical areas that KP serves While all regions in which KP operates are at risk of illnesses and loss of life due to extreme temperatures, the specific risk exposures may vary For example, while the Northern and Southern California regions are particularly affected by droughts, wildfires and heat waves, the Mid-Atlantic States and Georgia are more prone to severe storms and storm surges Hawaii and the Pacific Northwest are relatively more exposed to coastal flooding as well as heat waves In general, global warming can aggravate the effects of pre-existing health conditions such as chronic respiratory disease and asthma, due to increases in air pollutants and aeroallergens There is evidence of declining air quality in cities since greater heat can also worsen air pollution such as ground-level ozone or smog According to the National Center for Health Statistics, overall current asthma prevalence among adults increased from 20012002 (71%) to 20132014 (92%) By weight status, prevalence increased among overweight adults but not among adults in the obese or normal weight categoriesWith regard to secondary risks, climate-related disturbances in ecological systems, such as changes in the range of infective parasites, can increase the incidence of serious infectious diseases The tick that carries Lyme Disease is reported in 457% of US counties, up from 30% in 19983 Other secondary health effects of global warming include water- and food-borne diseases Warm temperatures also increase water pollution which harms human health In rural areas, increased food insecurity can occur due to geographical shifts in optimum growing conditions and decreases in crop yields; reduced water resources for agriculture and for human consumption; and loss of property such as cropland because of floods, droughts and a rise in sea level
With regard to tertiary risks, according to The Medical Society Consortium on Climate and Health: Many people exposed to the worst extreme weather events experience stress and serious mental health consequences including depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and increases in suicidal thoughts and behavior Such disasters are also associated with increases in alcohol or drug abuse Children may also experience prolonged separation from their parents Beyond the well-known risks specific disasters pose to our mental health, the physical, social, and economic stresses created by climate change all increase our risk of mental health problems

American Retirement Life Insurance Company," Environmental risks, including those associated with climate change, is also now an explicit risk, within Cignas enterprise risk register, which is formally reviewed on a quarterly basis

We consider a range of potential opportunities driven by physical climate risks, including changes in temperatures, precipitation patterns and sea levels Specifically, we consider the potential for changes in physical climate parameters to present a broader series of global public health challenges, such as those relating to (1) extreme weather events, (2) decreases in water supply, (3) heat exposure, and (4) declining crop yields In the short-term, extreme weather events have been prioritized as our greatest physical risk

We also consider how changes in physical and transition risks could also influence a series of socioeconomic challenges and opportunities that would likely impact the delivery of healthcare Examples could include health and hygiene issues due to migration, malnutrition, and increases in respiratory, bronchial, water-borne and other diseases Additionally, we consider how these negative societal and environmental impacts could present opportunities where Cigna, in particular, could provide products and services to help respond to these changes in physical climate parameters across the markets we serve 

The findings from considering both qualitative and qualitative scenarios related to climate change have influenced our business strategy and planning process through our (1) establishment of environmental targets, (2) identification of emissions reduction projects to support our targets, (3) pursuit of LEED® certification and ENERGY STAR® building ratings, and (4) investments in onsite renewable energy where we expect to generate and sell renewable energy credits

We consider all geographic locations and markets where we operate in addition to potential new markets under evaluation Additionally, we consider global environmental and socioeconomic trends, which may impact the value of our assets in addition to revenue and costs in our target markets In addition to engaging with our internal stakeholders to prioritize risks and opportunities, we also monitor the activities related to climate change risk among our key stakeholders, which include investors, corporate customers and industry peers

For example, based on the processes and considerations as described above, we have identified transition risks associated the variability in energy costs and increased stakeholder interest in climate change and broader environmental, social and governance performance As a result, increasing energy efficiency at our facilities has been prioritized due to (1) cost savings and risk mitigation opportunities, (2) identified value to our stakeholders and (3) alignment with our mission and the increasingly globalized nature of our operations We also have a Strategic Sustainability Performance Plan in place that includes formal policies on energy and water consumption, and direct and indirect carbon dioxide emissions We have also identified extreme weather events  notably hurricanes in the United States  as our greatest current physical climate risk To deliver on our mission, we must be prepared to provide our services and offer our products virtually without fail As such, we invest resources in Cignas Customer Disaster Response Program and Business Continuity and Data Center Recovery plans

Cignas mission is to improve the health, well-being, and peace of mind of the people we serve As such, we make the connection between personal health and the health of our environment To support our mission, we are focused on (1) reducing our energy, emissions and overall environmental footprint; (2) reusing and recycling more of what we consume; (3) increasing efficiencies in all our operations; and (4) engaging with our customers and key stakeholders to support our Cigna Connects corporate responsibility platform Additionally, our Enterprise Risk Management qualitative considerations include factors such as achieving shareholder value, strategy alignment with overall mission and vision, and reputation and brand impact

Chubb also engages with customers by providing incentives and discounts to certain accounts for environmentally friendly behaviors Specifically, Chubb will pay up to a certain amount to repair or replace damaged property if it is a ""green alternative"" This includes: energy efficient appliances, electronics, heating and cooling systems, home envelope materials, interior plumbing systems and lighting fixtures, low Volatile Organic Compound (VOC) paints, primers, solvents, finishes, adhesives, low emissions carpet and floor coverings, and Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) - certified wood There are also premium credits available to customers who demonstrate that they have taken preventative measures

We work with our agents and brokers to encourage our clients to take resiliency measures These policies developed and promoted by Chubb all encourage actions from Chubb's customer base that ultimately help to reduce GHG emissions Success is measured directly by improvement in the combined ratio and a reduction in losses incurred from that risk cohort For example, Chubbs risk engineering services work closely with clients that have exposure to wildfire risk to implement best practices to mitigate the impacts through vegetation management, defensible space, construction features, early warning systems, and more Chubb measures the success of this program through overall lower incurred losses for the book of business with wildfire exposure, including structures such as homes and buildings, saved from wildfire damage or destruction

Tokio Marine American Insurance Company," However, because of the controlled risk framework within which we operate, the Tokio Marine Group believes that our portfolios are constructed to withstand a volatile capital market environment that could result if climate change were to impact the planet For example, as a rule, we do not participate in bonds issued by coastal credits or bonds issued by insurance companies While the reasoning behind this decision is not directly related to climate change, we believe that both coastal credits and insurance companies could be negatively impacted should weather patterns become unstable

Where an additional risk may exist (ie regulatory, litigation, etc), the Tokio Marine
Group and its investment advisers assess and incorporate that risk into the pricing of the investment In addition, the Tokio Marine Groups portfolios are well diversified by
sector, subsector, and Issuer due to the risk management constraints placed on all of
our managed portfolios Due to the vast number of potential outcomes that could result due to climate change or extreme, environmentally stressful events, it is difficult if not impossible to predict winners and losers

While rainfall totals or storm frequency may create some shott tenn economic turbulence, climate change is typically a long-term phenomenon whose affects are slow to accumulate and, therefore, recognizable well in advance We believe, therefore, that a well-diversified portfolio is the best defense against such occurrences In addition, investment advisors incorporate ESG (Environmental/Social/Governance) measurement and scoring into their credit research and review process when reviewing and determining investments for the Tokio Marine Group",4

North American Elite Insurance Company," A central pillar of the strategy is to reduce its carbon footprint In 2003, Swiss Re became the first major financial player to commit to going carbon neutral

Our strategy to tackle climate change rests on four pillars, one of which is our pledge to reduce our own CO2 emissions Our Greenhouse Neutral Program has been the principal initiative to achieve this goal Originally launched in 2003 for a ten-year period, it combined two commitments:  firstly, to reduce our CO2 emissions per employee (full-time equivalent or FTE) by a specified  amount;  secondly, to fully offset all the remaining emissions by purchasing high-quality emission reduction credits, thus making the company greenhouse neutral for the whole period between 2003 and 2013 Over the course of the ten years, we gradually raised our reduction target from 15% to 45% per employee By the end of the programs first cycle in 2013, we had achieved a total reduction in CO2 emissions per employee of 493% compared to the base year 2003 Our new target is to keep our CO2 emissions per employee stable at the level of 2013 In view of our expansive business strategy, especially in high growth markets, we consider this to be an ambitious goal 

For the programs second cycle, we also extended the scope of our emissions reporting and of our offsetting commitment In addition to our Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions (heating and power consumption) and a major source of Scope 3 emissions (business travel), our reporting now covers further activities along our supply chain (Scope 3): employee commuting, copy paper use, waste generation, water use and technical gases Based on this, we extended our commitment to offset the CO2 emissions we cannot avoid to paper, waste, water and technical gases In 2016, total CO2 emissions per employee (FTE) increased by 62% and were thus 39% higher than in 2013 The main reason was a significant rise in business travel, which outweighed further gains in our energy intensity A second factor was that we created jobs in countries where power consumption is relatively carbon intensive, eg in India
 
Swiss Re has implemented a number of projects that reduce our environmental footprint:

	First, whenever possible, we purchase power from renewable sources This has been a key measure of our Greenhouse Neutral Program After starting to use renewable power at four European locations in 2005, we set ourselves the goal of using 100% renewable power at all locations where it is available in reliable and trustworthy quality by the end of 2013 Based on our quality assessments of available energy sources, we believe we reached this goal and used 100% renewable power at 25 locations in Asia, Europe, North America and Oceania as per the end of 2013 We are committed to source 100% of our energy needs from renewable sources at all our locations This is challenging because in a number of countries, there is a lack of renewable energy supplies This is why we helped to establish the Climate Groups RE100 initiative in 2014 as a founding member The goal of this initiative is to unite 100 of the worlds largest companies in a shared commitment to use 100% renewable power by 2020 To achieve this, the group approaches policymakers and regulators at national and sub-national level to increase renewable energy availability RE100 grew substantially again in 2016 and included more than 96 of the worlds largest companies at the end of 2016 We have recently also started to build our own solar power facilities Our large office at Armonk in New York State is our US headquarters, with more than 700 employees At Climate Week NYC 2016, we announced our decision to build a solar power plant directly on our own premises to supply our office with renewable power

	Second, we have made continuous efforts to lower the actual amount of energy consumed per employee, ie to reduce our energy intensity In the first phase of our Greenhouse Neutral Program, we set ourselves a 20% reduction target compared with 2003 levels, measured in kWh per employee Through many small measures to improve energy efficiency and by concentrating back office tasks in fewer and more energy-efficient buildings, we actually achieved a reduction of 465% by 2013 For the second phase of our Greenhouse Neutral Program (base year 2013), our commitment is to continuously reduce energy intensity by 2% per year As a matter of fact, our energy intensity was 185% lower at the end of 2016 than in 2013 Partly, we achieved this by decommissioning existing office buildings and moving into more energy-efficient ones

	Third, we continuously monitor all travel budgets and collect travel data centrally  Business travel easily constitutes Swiss Res largest emissions source today We have taken several measures to reduce the need for business travel and to curb unnecessary business trips, including increased use of videoconferencing services  Despite these measures, the amount of kilometers travelled per employee and the associated emissions have been rising in recent years  A key driver is our continued expansion in high growth markets, which has brought an increase in teams distributed across different locations In 2016, the total distance each of our employees travelled on average increased by 86%

	Fourth, we have taken a number of measures to reduce waste internally  We have reduced the average amount of paper used by our employees in recent years by increasing access to scanning services While it is difficult for us to influence water use and waste generation at locations where we rent office space, we ensure appliances meet high standards of water efficiency in the office buildings we own Where possible, we strive to have waste-free office locations  For example, the Overland Park, KS, office is engaged in a pilot program to go waste-free and has not sent materials to a landfill for more than a year
  
	Fifth, the second commitment of our Greenhouse Neutral Program is to compensate all CO2 emissions we cannot avoid For the seven emissions sources covered in the second phase of our Greenhouse Neutral Program, we bought and retired Voluntary Emission Reductions (VERs) for a total of 80,700 tons of CO2-eq (CO2 equivalent) in 2016 We are keen to ensure that the VERs we buy are of a high environmental standard Therefore, we have developed a set of criteria to select projects that generate certificates In particular, we give priority to those which create strong social side-effects and benefit the poorest regions

	Sixth, Swiss Re incorporates environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria in its entire investment portfolio By implementing ESG benchmarks, Swiss Re makes ESG consideration an integral part of its investment process Furthermore, we stopped investing in companies that generate 30% or more of their revenues from thermal coal mining or that use at least 30% thermal coal for power generation We divested from all related equity positions and the vast majority of our fixed income holdings Additionally, Swiss Re targets a green bond portfolio of USD 15bn, primarily relying on Green Bond Principles, and invest in renewables and social infrastructure in our infrastructure private debt mandates For further information on our ESG approach, please see the following website and publication http://wwwswissrecom/about_us/about_our_business/asset_management/Responsible_Investments__Shaping_the_future_of_investinghtml; http://mediaswissrecom/documents/ZRH-17-11623-P1_Responsible%20Investments_WEBPDF

While there is a potential for climate change to also affect the frequency and severity of wind related storms over a long period of time, the Company believes that a pro-active annual rate review process will over time account for any short term changes from climate change Since climate change is viewed as a long-term changing of atmospheric conditions, we do not believe it is appropriate to price for or underwrite against perils that have not yet occurred As the Company reviews changes in its own data and industry trends, we believe the short-term changes will over time build towards an adjustment for the long-term additional windstorm peril risks The Company does use hurricane models from multiple vendors to understand short term hurricane risk as the basis for short-term (one to two year) exposure management and reinsurance purchasing decisions We understand that the model vendors make updates annual to their models to account for changes that their experts believe are occurring in the frequency and severity of hurricane events Again, we believe by continually monitoring changes to the model vendor results and validating our Companys actual experience against model estimates, that the Company is well positioned to alter its long-term strategies if short-term changes arise

The Company has not stress tested any model changes that could arise from climate change The Company reviews multiple hurricane and severe convective storm models each year to gain insights on a wide range of possible outcomes The Company believes that any short-term changes are within a reasonable range of the distribution of current model estimates and that the Company buys sufficient reinsurance on an annual basis to account for a substantial range of possible outcomes

Due to the short term nature of the Companys business (annual contracts with severe weather events known during contract periods), the Company does not believe that modelling beyond the 1-5 year period is necessary As changes arise to Company or industry trends, the Company is prepared to annually make rating and underwriting decisions to mitigate future short-term risk (1-5 years), however does not view longer-term scenario testing a pertinent to the operations of the Company

Professional Insurance Company," We also have an internal International Sustainability Council that convenes on a broad range of environmental issues 

Our Investments Team comprises investment professionals across assets classes that include public and private fixed income, real estate, commercial mortgage lending and common stocks

Investments: At Sun Life, our investment practices adopt a long-term view, and incorporate environmental, social and governance (ESG) considerations when reviewing investment opportunities Investments are made after thorough research and analysis, which includes looking at a variety of relevant factors and assessing the long-term sustainability and growth of the companies and opportunities in which we invest

Our robust investment processes are designed to consider and manage numerous investment risks, including relevant ESG risks We identify material macro changes in the environment and evaluate companies changing strategies to determine whether theyve adequately identified disruptions and opportunities As these risks are identified, they are factored into our investment strategy, which is continually re-evaluated, and enables us to appropriately position our portfolio

Our Investments Team has established multiple systematic processes to help identify potential macro changes through top-down and bottom-up analysis For example, the senior members of the Investment Team attend quarterly strategy sessions where a wide range of topics are debated including current environment, economic and market forecasts, and other concerns or opportunities including, as appropriate, industry specific events The North American energy industry was a feature topic at a 2013 strategy session

Fixed income: Our Credit Analysts in our Public Fixed Income Team are responsible for monitoring companies and industries globally They are responsible for determining the appropriateness of an investment in a particular issuer, and for evaluating information on macro trends or industry shifts They regularly hold in-depth sector reviews Investments employees from the other asset classes are invited to attend these sector reviews For any macro economic or regulatory changes that we determine to be of potential environmental impact, we hold specific cross asset class discussions to share information and formulate our strategy, as well as to ensure that we are properly identifying any potential secondary risks For Private Fixed Income investments where the primary security is real estate, an important aspect of the underwriting process is an assessment of the security for existing and potential environmental risks

The Company also has in place an International Sustainability Council composed of senior representatives from key, relevant functions such as risk management, investments, finance, human resources, legal, public affairs, and shared services (including procurement and global facilities management) The International Sustainability Council periodically reports progress relating to sustainability to the senior executives of the Company The International Sustainability Council meets bi-monthly and is finalizing a new sustainability policy, which includes reference to climate change 

In general, our Enterprise Risk Framework sets out processes for risk appetite identification, measurement and assessment, response development, monitoring and control, and reporting and communication The framework recognizes the importance of risk culture in effective enterprise risk management Our risk culture is well-defined and embedded in our day-to-day business activities All business segments employ a common approach to identify, measure and assess risks, evaluate potential correlation between various risk events and categories, and monitor emerging risks and industry developments We have a process to identify and monitor emerging risks that may have a material impact on our finances, operations or reputation Management provides various risk reports to the Board, its committees and management committees including the Risk Review and Executive Risk Committees

In general, all risks are considered as part of our Enterprise Risk Framework Enterprise risk ranking and heat map covering all risks are presented at the Risk Review Committee and Executive Risk Committee on an annual basis On a quarterly basis, a key risk report, which includes the enterprise heat map and commentary thereon, is presented to the Risk Review Committee and the Executive Risk Committee and highlights key risks in current business plans and mitigating action plans New products or any product initiative where risk is assessed as high or extreme require a risk assessment to be submitted to the Chief Actuary and the Chief Risk Officer (all risks are in scope) The assessment includes a comparison to the Companys desired risk appetite and profile Finally, risk mitigation options are developed and assessed

Our risk appetite is aligned with our overall corporate vision, mission and business strategy This alignment is obtained by the consideration of key risks that we are willing to accept in order to achieve a certain level of return, and successfully achieve our stated mission to help customers achieve lifetime financial security and our business objectives These key risks include insurance risks, market risks, credit risks, liquidity risks and operational risks and we have established a range of explicit risk appetite limits and operational control points for these risks 

We seek to allocate our risk-taking capacity in a manner that optimizes the overall level of risk-adjusted returns and stakeholder value creation Budgeting of risk-taking capacity is managed through the application of risk limits and the embedding of strong risk management discipline into a wide range of key management decision-making processes

For the insurance industry climate change obviously poses a significant risk in that weather events are potentially becoming more volatile and severe This ranges from severe winter storms to flooding to wildfire risk caused by drought Mutual of Enumclaw manages these risks through underwriting activities to ensure the company is not over-exposed for any one risk and through reinsurance partners as described earlier Other risks posed by climate change are regulatory in nature If regulatory agencies do not let the insurance mechanism work naturally and introduce mandates for coverage, then companies will suffer as they loses ability to manage their risk portfolio The basic tenet of insurability of risk is that it must be measurable and random in nature It is also important that companies have the ability to determine what risks they will insure so as to manage their overall mix of business effectively and prudently Other risks of climate change may be judicial as we may begin seeing litigation around climate based change and potential law suits accusing businesses of causing the change This can bring additional loss costs to the company that were not anticipated when drafting the coverage grants in the policies

Foremost Property and Casualty Insurance Company,"  We expect the overall losses from the perils of Wildfire, Flood and Hurricane, which some experts state are sensitive to climate change, to increase for society as a whole, and the insurance industry  Wildfire risk is of particular concern to us given our concentration in the western United States  We also expect increased severity and frequency of Severe Convective Storms  In addition, multiple causation risks, including natural and man-made causes, make it more challenging to fully understanding and quantify our exposure to risk

Farmers uses both internal and external catastrophe models to make our best assessment of prospective catastrophe risk for pricing, capital optimization and reinsurance purposes  We adjust the models based on our own experience, research and historical model performance  Our modeling work generates outputs on a deterministic and probabilistic basis which we use to manage our enterprise view of risk  While the modeling data and outputs continue to improve over time, there is still uncertainty around the outputs  Farmers views this uncertainty as a reason to be cautious and conservative in our selection and pricing of risk, and our overall tolerance of catastrophe exposure

An increasing number of regulatory functions encourage us to view risk arising from climate change  However, other regulatory functions disallow the use of this view in our pricing or risk selection and require that we underwrite our business without consideration of climate change  Many states do not permit the use of near term hurricane models that account for current sea temperatures and other factors which are viewed to be related to climate change  Other states do not permit the use of wildfire models, although these states will attest that we are in a period of higher than average fire risk  Some states will not permit changes to the models based on our experience, which limits our ability to utilize our experience and expertise in our business  We believe the insurance industry would be better able to address climate change and provide leadership on this issue if each state worked towards a consistent standard regarding climate change  As the populace is being encouraged to prepare and live as if climate change is real, the insurance industry must be permitted to do the same  

While climate change presents uncertainty, our continued work on model validation and correlation provides us with some level of comfort, at least over the next few years, that we can reasonably estimate our expected catastrophe losses during that time, with one major exception 

What we cannot account for or incorporate in our pricing or our own internal view of risk, is the exposure presented by regulatory uncertainty  Regulatory uncertainty includes actions such as directives issued by state insurance departments and governors limiting the application of hurricane and/or named storm deductibles to Superstorm Sandy claims, the reopening of earthquake claims numerous years after the Northridge Earthquake, the attempt to retroactively assess insurers for Texas Windstorm Insurance Association losses five years after Hurricane Ike, and other post event changes made to commonly understood practices that were instrumental in our decision to insure these risks  These types of actions cannot be predicted, and thus cannot be incorporated into our models

Equitable Life & Casualty Ins Co,  Other efforts are considered and acted upon,7
USAA Life Ins Co,"  This is ultimately used as part of determining our risk profile and adjusting exposures accordingly  Enterprise Capital and Liquidity requirements are based in part on these catastrophe models The following categories have been identified as significant risks for USAA: 

(1)	Hurricanes represent USAAs largest catastrophe risk exposure  Hurricane Harvey in Texas has once again proved the devastating impact that intense hurricanes can have on communities as well as the risk exposure for insurers Various hurricane models and research suggest that storm intensity may increase due to changing weather patterns, leading to higher societal costs  This is exacerbated when combined with increasing property values and population growth in catastrophe-prone areas USAA is committed to preserving its financial strength over the long-term, and we take the uncertainties surrounding natural catastrophes into consideration when setting conservative capital requirements For example, USAAs capital requirements are more conservative than those suggested by regulatory and rating agencies As a result, the company is prepared to withstand a 1-in-1,000 year catastrophe event and maintains a much more conservative premium-to-surplus ratio than regulators or rating agencies require 
(2)	Storm Surge and Flood - scientific research has demonstrated a rise in global sea levels, increasing the impacts of storm surge USAAs current exposure to storm surge risk is greatly mitigated through the use of coastal underwriting requirements  Areas with high storm surge exposures are only written when members meet exceptional requirements, such as  an Institute for Business and Home Safety (IBHS) fortified home Flood risk represents less than 1% of USAAs catastrophe exposure  the majority of which corresponds to renters and automobiles (the federal government provides coverage for homeowners and other property products through the National Flood Insurance Program) 
(3)	Wildfires - Due to the effects of drought, untamed vegetation, and land development, wildfires have been increasing in terms of frequency and severity  Wildfire exposure continues to grow in the United States, and USAA is working on more robust wildfire risk assessment, including modeling capabilities outside of California In addition, prevention efforts are being expanded to further protect our members For example, USAA provides members with access to multiple programs and services to help them mitigate wildfire-related property loss We offer many members in high-risk wildfire areas: 
	Wildfire Response Program: One of the great benefits we offer to our members in 14 states most susceptible to wildfires is a wildfire response program through Wildfire Defense Systems (WDS) Members in those states who have a USAA homeowners or rental insurance policy can enroll in the program at no additional cost WDS monitors wildfire activity and takes proactive mitigation measures to help protect a USAA members property when an active wildfire looms nearby In the program, WDS uses certified wild land firefighters to safely go behind fire lines (with permission from the Incident Commander) to assess potential risk and assist with mitigation efforts WDS can go into an evacuation zone and to member homes before a fire reaches them and take measures to help prevent a loss (reinforcing mitigations actions members should also do, such as closing windows and garage doors, moving wood piles away from the homes, clearing debris from under wood decks, clearing gutters, and removing debris from rooftops) After the fire sweeps through the area, WDS may go back to member homes and make sure no spot fires are smoldering that still could cause damage 

	USAAs Property Risk Assessment Tool: Too often, homebuyers purchase a property only to learn later that it is in an area prone to natural disasters USAAs Property Risk Assessment Tool helps members eliminate those unpleasant surprises The online tool enables members to plug in the address of any US home and get information about the propertys general exposure to various natural disasters, such as wildfire and flood It also offers tips on how to reduce the likelihood or impact of loss

	Firewise Communities: USAA actively supports the development of recognized Firewise Communities, which decrease the risk of losses due to wildfires USAA is the only major national insurance carrier to offer a discount for communities who are recognized with the NFPA Firewise designation  USAA also actively partners with many state and local government agencies to promote Firewise principles and help communities learn best practices in taking steps towards living in harmony with the local fire ecology that prevails in their geographic location  USAA also actively supports research to determine what factors most influence social behavior to motivate communities to choose to become Firewise

	WDSpro app: WDSpro is a free mobile app available for members who reside in pre-selected single family homes in/near high wildfire risk areas and are insured with USAA It empowers members to capture key information about their property along with photos of their homes exterior and surroundings and send this information to experts for a wildfire risk assessment The risk assessment provides step-by-step advice on actions they can take to minimize fire risks The information members provide in the app will not affect their insurance policy or premiums

Farmers Insurance Company of Arizona,"

For the homeowners market, in some states and for both our NextGeneration and Smart Plan Home products, we offer the Eco Rebuild endorsement  This provides additional coverage for the cost to rebuild, repair, or replace a home with green building materials  If the home is Energy Star Qualified, the endorsement covers the cost to upgrade damaged property to meet new minimum standards for Energy Star homes  Additionally, if the customers home is equipped with alternative power generating equipment, Eco Rebuild pays for additional costs to purchase power from a utility company, and compensates the insured for the loss of public utility credits or rebates

As indicated in our response to Question 6 above, some of our officers are involved with organizations that have interests that intersect, or overlap with, the interests of organizations that focus on climate change  These include the Institute for Business and Home Safety (IBHS), the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, and the Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety  For example, IBHS works to reduce the social and economic effects of natural disasters and other property losses by conducting research and advocating improved construction, maintenance and preparation practices  We are also involved with organizations in Michigan that promote an environmentally conscious approach to business in that state  These are the Land Conservancy of Western Michigan and the Western Michigan Sustainable Business Forum

And, as mentioned earlier, Farmers is active in multiple fire safety, prevention and training boards  These include the California State Board of Fire Services, which provides a forum for addressing fire protection and prevention issues  We also participate in the Fire Safe Council, which provides resources for establishing and maintaining local Councils, and the Fire Safety Institute, which focuses on providing quality firefighter training and promoting firefighter safety",6
"American Family Insurance Company, S.I.","  This includes providing customers with informational newsletters and brochures related to loss reduction  For example, we provide brochures that outline how to reduce wildfire risk  We also offer discounts in many states for customers that have impact-resistant roof materials and a discount for customers who utilize connected home Loss control services are available for commercial and farm/ranch accounts  Flood coverage is available through our agents via the National Flood Insurance Program 
Futhermore, American Family is a member of the Insurance Institute for Business and Home Safety (IBHS)  The following text, prepared by IBHS, is a brief description of the Institute and some of its activities that relate to the issue of climate change
IBHS is a 501(c)(3) organization, wholly supported by the property (re)insurance industry, which conducts objective, scientific research to identify and promote effective actions that strengthen homes, businesses and communities against natural disasters and other causes of loss IBHS does this by identifying and advocating improved property design, construction, retrofitting, maintenance, repair and preparation practices  IBHS guidance for mitigating property losses is available directly to the public and to our members/policyholders, at wwwdisastersafetyorg, and through social media (eg, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, YouTube and Vimeo)
IBHS advocates the concept of going green and building strong recognizing that addressing climate change involves reducing greenhouse gas emissions and adapting homes, businesses, and communities to severe weather that may result from climate change:
	As an insurance-supported organization, IBHS recognizes that climate change strategies must do more than build structures to be energy efficient  They must be built to modern fire protection standards to help resist fire and avoid the water/chemical deluge needed for fire suppression; they should be strong enough to avoid wind destruction and resulting relocation in landfills; and properties should be sited and elevated in a manner that protects against flooding and environmental degradation from landslides  All of these are part of going green
	IBHS also firmly believes that adaptation is critical, not only to reduce long-term property insurance losses, but to buttress individual and societal resilience  All of the property protection measures that IBHS advocates to strengthen structures against current weather threats will also reduce future losses caused by climate change events  And, the unprecedented scientific research conducted at the unique IBHS Research Center is critical to identification of new mitigation actions that may help protect against more severe weather events
	Additionally, research conducted by IBHS will help to make sure that green building enhancements do not inadvertently cause structures to be less disaster-resistant, or even worse, threaten the life safety of occupants or first respondersfor example, photovoltaic arrays that take flight or pose fire suppression challenges are the antithesis of building strong  

In 2014, American Family Insurance partnered with IBHS through a first-of-its-kind national study that will support IBHS researchers over the next 25 years in identifying the effects of aging on residential roofing materials, with the ultimate goal of making residential roofs last longer and leak less ultimately helping customers mitigate risks The study will determine how Midwest weather affects different brands of roofing material, using a dozen scientifically instrumented roof structures built on a bare patch of ground at American Familys corporate headquarters This is a part of a larger study driven by IBHS and other participating member companies 

In 2015, American Family partnered with Nest Labs to offer Nest products to insured homeowners in an effort to reduce losses related to fire, water damage and exposure to carbon monoxide poisoning

Truck Insurance Exchange," As a long-term investor focused on managing assets to liabilities, we believe that investors taking both financial and non-financial considerations into account when making investment decisions will be the most successful in the long term Issues such as corporate governance, climate change, use of natural resources, health and safety, labor relations and human rights can be important drivers of investment risk and reward

We believe that a pro-active integration of relevant Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) factors into the investment process alongside traditional financial metrics and state-of-the-art risk management practices could support our investment result However, integration of such factors requires diligence, expertise and focus We do not believe that simply dedicating specific investment portfolios to the latest climate branded product of the asset management industry creates sustainable value for our stakeholders and the environment

Our investments are primarily managed by third-party asset managers, and it is at this level that individual security selection decisions are made These asset managers operate within agreed portfolio guidelines set by Farmers and take all aspects into account, both financial and non-financial, when managing Farmers individual portfolios to ensure maximum value creation

As our core competency is selecting the right asset managers and evaluating them based on their superior investment processes, we have taken the following actions:

     1)	For the procurement of new asset managers, we include questions related to the inclusion of ESG factors in the investment process into our request for proposal (RFP)

     2)	We have implemented the capability to monitor ESG ratings provided by MSCI in our risk systems This allows us to enter into a proactive dialogue with our asset managers about risk exposures to environmental factors

Plaza Insurance Company,"  The company is in a service industry, which is considered to be a relatively low contributor to emissions  The company recognizes it is important to consider the impact it has on the environment It encourages a culture in which all of its employees are aware of opportunities to conserve energy and be good stewards of natural resources  State Auto is committed to implementing efficiencies as opportunities are evaluated and potential environmental impacts are considered  Such efforts diminish the environmental footprint, which in turn has beneficial effects on pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, landfill burdens and fuel and water consumption  

State Auto works to purchase and use energy in an efficient, cost effective and responsible manner This affects the way we manage facilities, a fleet of vehicles and travel For example, the company uses fuel efficient vehicles, monitors regular maintenance and strives to effectively manage the total number of vehicles During 2018 the company upgraded fleet vehicles in order to reduce our carbon footprint by over 168,000 lbs of CO2 each year  Over the past few years, weve reduced the number of fleet vehicles by 122, while growing our core business   

In conjunction with the SMART Columbus initiative, State Auto introduced a ride share program in the first half of 2019 As many employees commute to business locations, State Auto promotes carpooling programs and encourages ridesharing, the use of public transportation and biking to work  We continue to support a CoGo Bike Share station on our corporate headquarters campus This provides easy access to associates for short trips in our downtown area  We encourage work from home options whenever possible to further reduce the need for commuting and additional office space State Auto is committed to serving customers locally, placing field associates near independent agency representatives and policyholders, reducing the need for planes, trains and longer automobile rides  To further limit travel, the company utilizes telephonic and web-based conferences, along with video conferencing systems in multiple employee locations 

State Auto is involved in a multi-year project to consolidate our central Ohio employees into one work location, our corporate headquarters We are renovating floors in our buildings each year to allow for the movement of associates from outside locations into our headquarters We expect this process to be completed by the end of 2021 2018  renovation accomplishments include the  installation of  a new high efficiency  roof and replacement of 50 water pumps through-out the buildings These new, more energy efficient pumps help to provide heat to the buildings

Floor renovations noted above include a brighter, more efficient use of energy and space Sensors allow for lights to automatically turn off  when work areas are not in use  New work stations allow for a more collaborative work environment and reduce the required square footage per associate 

We joined the Energy Star program to measure energy use 2018 will be our baseline year, allowing us to measure the impact of building upgrades and renovations in 2019-2021 

Our mission to improve use of space and energy goes beyond our corporate headquarters location We moved our Indianapolis, IN associates to a newer more energy efficient location Similar actions are underway in our Nashville, TN and  West Des Moine, IA offices These relocations should be completed by the end of 2019  
      
Changes made in the past few years include:
-	At two of its largest owned facilities, State Auto utilizes the most efficient chillers available today  
-	State Auto has updated its corporate headquarters building with high efficiency gas boilers
-	A campaign to replace its lighting with LED bulbs  In 2016 the lights in the main parking lot at the corporate headquarters were updated to include LED bulbs In 2017 we converted to LED lighting in our Nashville Center 
-	The company works to reduce the amount of paper and office supplies used This includes taking advantage of opportunities to use online and electronic communications, rather than paper Air dryers have been installed in new bathrooms to help further our quest to minimize waste 

We  completed  the  rollout of  a new mainframe system for the issuance and administration of personal and commercial lines policies These new products are digital, utilizing electronic transmission of policy and billing information to our agents and insureds, dramatically reducing the amount of paper being consumed Recycling of paper is encouraged and facilitated, along with recycling of cardboard, plastic, glass and cans  Such recycling efforts have been in place for well over 10 years We support a composting program in our corporate headquarters to minimize the amount of material going to our local landfill Automatic fixtures and waterless urinals are used in a growing number of restrooms and green traps have also been installed in bathrooms  which help with water conservation   We maintain a strict preventative maintenance schedule for equipment, which also benefits the reduction of energy usage and emissions

Soundpath Health,"  The Company does not deem the risk of climate change to its business operations to be significant in the near term  However, the Company will continue to periodically assess how climate change could impact its operations, and will develop a formal risk management plan related to climate change at such point the Company determines that those risks could be significantly impactful to its business operations",3
Oglesby Reinsurance Company," It may include the effects from the increase in severity and occurrence of climate change-related weather events (some may include but are not limited to: thunderstorms - including severe hail and strong winds; tornadoes; hurricanes; windstorms; the aftermath of floods; heat waves; droughts; rise in sea-level; forest fires; grass fires and the resultant subsequent debilitating effects created by these events)

Although State Farm does not specifically differentiate any increase or decrease in severity and occurrence of weather events to specific measures of climate, State Farm continuously measures and models risk for the perils insured under its contracts to determine its total risk exposure including those related to weather events Over the period from 1984 - 2019, non-hurricane catastrophe losses have been increasing by an average of 24%, with four of the largest ten non-hurricane catastrophe years occurring in the last ten years after adjusting for policy growth   This trend is the result of several factors such as population concentration, population shift to the coastal regions and other catastrophe prone areas, land use, as well as, changes to weather patterns related to climate change 

Climate change is a recognized risk category on the risk register managed by Enterprise Risk Management  Evaluating climate change risk is done by the various units of the company(s) handling separate general functions, such as administrative services, investments, law department, public affairs, underwriting and actuarial, and the information developed is reported through the Enterprise Risk Management process to the Risk Committee of the State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company Board   Within each function, there are several individuals and teams responsible for identifying and monitoring the potential risk and creating strategies to mitigate and manage such risk to financially sound levels  Each function team is evaluating and determining how best to approach the evaluation For example, multiple models are used to underwrite certain exposures, including those based on historical data and others on changing weather patterns  In these efforts to evaluate and model weather related effects State Farm is continuously investing in the latest tools and improving techniques to model severe weather in order to accurately measure risk to better match risk to price of the various products

State Farm is taking several actions to address the risk of climate change, which includes maintaining a focus on environmental sustainability efforts  State Farm is committed to operating in environmentally sustainable ways and building safer, stronger, and more sustainable communities, demonstrated by the establishment of a dedicated cross-departmental team in 2019 to execute on the State Farm environmental sustainability strategy focused on supporting internal operations, strengthening and promoting community resilience, and promoting responsible business practices 

State Farm promotes improved building code adoption through its federal and state lobbying efforts to help mitigate potential risk Additionally, State Farm works with organizations across the country, such as the Insurance Institute for Business and Home Safety and the Federal Alliance for Safe Homes, engaging in research which may help protect customers from injuries, property destruction, and financial harm that can result from natural disasters State Farm is also a member of the Build-Strong Coalition These efforts are focused on building codes, land use, and general awareness of mitigation issues 

Yes - The company has a climate change policy with respect to investment management

Risks associated with State Farms investments are continuously monitored and evaluated in order to preserve State Farms financial strength to ensure we can meet our obligations to our policyholders  State Farms investment analysis evaluates all material risk factors, including Environmental, Social, and Governance factors that may have an impact on a companys future prospects, operating performance, or future valuation  Additionally, State Farm monitors and evaluates changes in climate and weather patterns in conjunction with assessments of changing sources of energy and the innovation necessary to produce economic and reliable energy 
 
The impact of climate change is managed through diversification guidelines across various asset types to prevent concentrations in a given geographic location, industry, property type, or municipal funding  Restrictions on investments in unregulated coal-fueled energy generation limit our exposure within the utilities industry  Coastal and earthquake exposures are managed in our commercial mortgage loan and real estate portfolios and are considered when evaluating investments in municipalities  In our real estate portfolio, we focus on the efficient operation of a building in an environmentally responsible manner and we evaluate new investments to determine whether it is economically and physically feasible to achieve a LEED certification  We also annually identify capital improvement projects and building system enhancements to reduce the use of energy 

Additionally, we provide financing to entities that are engaged in energy efficiency projects as well as other green initiatives as a subset of their business operations, such as municipal and state governments as well as utilities and energy companies
  
The Investment Committee of the Board of Directors receives regular reports of investment diversification and exposures by various classifications, including geographic, industry, and property type

Futhermore, American Family is a member of the Insurance Institute for Business and Home Safety (IBHS)  The following text, prepared by IBHS, is a brief description of the Institute and some of its activities that relate to the issue of climate change
IBHS is a 501(c)(3) organization, wholly supported by the property (re)insurance industry, which conducts objective, scientific research to identify and promote effective actions that strengthen homes, businesses and communities against natural disasters and other causes of loss IBHS does this by identifying and advocating improved property design, construction, retrofitting, maintenance, repair and preparation practices  IBHS guidance for mitigating property losses is available directly to the public and to our members/policyholders, at wwwdisastersafetyorg, and through social media (eg, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, YouTube and Vimeo)
IBHS advocates the concept of going green and building strong recognizing that addressing climate change involves reducing greenhouse gas emissions and adapting homes, businesses, and communities to severe weather that may result from climate change:
	As an insurance-supported organization, IBHS recognizes that climate change strategies must do more than build structures to be energy efficient  They must be built to modern fire protection standards to help resist fire and avoid the water/chemical deluge needed for fire suppression; they should be strong enough to avoid wind destruction and resulting relocation in landfills; and properties should be sited and elevated in a manner that protects against flooding and environmental degradation from landslides  All of these are part of going green
	IBHS also firmly believes that adaptation is critical, not only to reduce long-term property insurance losses, but to buttress individual and societal resilience  All of the property protection measures that IBHS advocates to strengthen structures against current weather threats will also reduce future losses caused by climate change events  And, the unprecedented scientific research conducted at the unique IBHS Research Center is critical to identification of new mitigation actions that may help protect against more severe weather events
	Additionally, research conducted by IBHS will help to make sure that green building enhancements do not inadvertently cause structures to be less disaster-resistant, or even worse, threaten the life safety of occupants or first respondersfor example, photovoltaic arrays that take flight or pose fire suppression challenges are the antithesis of building strong

State Worker's Insurance Fund,  Our investment strategy takes into consideration the impact of the reinsurance plan,4
New Hampshire Insurance Company," 

i) the scope of process:
At AIG PC, risk management includes the identification and measurement of various forms of risk, the establishment of risk thresholds and the creation of processes intended to maintain risks within these thresholds while optimizing returns We consider risk management an integral part of managing our core businesses and a key element of our approach to corporate governance

We have an integrated, multi-disciplinary process for managing risks throughout our organization in accordance with our firm-wide risk appetite Our Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) Department supervises and integrates the risk management functions in each of our business units, providing senior management with a consolidated view of the firms major risk positions ERM monitors all significant enterprise risks and opportunities on a regular basis, including future, potentially material, risks related to climate change, such as catastrophic weather

To control catastrophe exposure, AIG uses a combination of techniques, including setting key business unit limits based on an aggregate PML (probable maximum loss), monitoring and modeling accumulated exposures, and purchasing catastrophe reinsurance to supplement our other reinsurance protections

With these multiple levels of risk management processes in place and integrated across AIG, modeling and underwriting practices may continue to adapt to the developing risk exposures attributed to climate change

ii) how risks/opportunities are assessed at a company level:
Risks or opportunities related to climate change are assessed at the company level through a multi-layered risk management organizational structure  AIGs Board of Directors oversees the management of risk through the complementary functioning of the Finance and Risk Management Committee and the Audit Committee and interaction with other committees of the Board  Next, the Group Risk Committee (the GRC) is the senior management group charged with assessing all significant risk issues on a global basis in order to protect AIGs financial strength, optimizing intrinsic value, and protecting AIGs reputation among key stakeholders The management committees that support the GRC are charged with identifying, analyzing and reviewing specific risk matters within their respective mandates, and are comprised of senior executives and experienced business representatives from a range of functions and business units throughout AIG and its subsidiaries

AIG PC considers climate change as it relates to future risk exposures through an Environmental Working Group (EWG), made up of senior staff from across the organization, including Enterprise Risk Management Following assessments of recent natural catastrophes, AIG recognizes the impact of environmental change on the risk profile The EWG was established to develop a framework for AIG PC to establish a view on the impact and risk of anthropogenic environmental change and its impact on AIGs business This includes better understanding what the climate science indicates about changes to the environment and a strategy to better anticipate changes that can influence AIGs risk profile

An example of a climate change-related (non-hurricane) risk identification and analysis currently being undertaken by AIG PCs Catastrophe Management and Analytics Center of Excellence is the Climate Informed Global Flood Risk Assessment  The project is developing innovative modeling frameworks for local and global flood risk estimation, and supporting them through the integration of rainfall simulation, hydrologic and hydraulic modeling, statistical models, key topography, asset, population density, climate and other socio-economic data bases This will provide a robust platform for the best possible flood risk estimates in a changing climate for actuarial and portfolio analysis using all information sources as they are updated  The project methodology will be applied to several global regions where recent mega-floods have led to concerns, and test the predictive analysis by focusing on key attributes of different settings of interest The model is also intended to assess the financial impacts of flooding of assets at risk within the region(s) for which policies are written, or whose disruption (eg, transportation networks) would result in business disruption or loss of use claims

iii) how risks/opportunities are assessed at an asset level:
Risks and opportunities are generally assessed at an enterprise or business unit level, but the AIG PC EWG is comprised of members from throughout AIGs individual asset levels and business units who may elevate relevant climate-change related risk information up to the enterprise risk level for assessment as appropriate

At a physical asset level, AIG does assess the risks and opportunities associated with the physical impacts of climate change, including individual facilities and office locations AIG has a Business Continuity plan to respond to any incident that may disrupt business operations, including extreme weather events In fact, the impact of Superstorm Sandy crystallized the importance of business continuity planning and the role of insurance The effect of Sandy raised awareness and heightened the perspective of such catastrophic events, particularly in the property and environmental markets

iv) the frequency of monitoring (in weeks/months/years):
Enterprise wide risks are evaluated and monitored at least annually at the multiple governance levels described above (ie, Group Risk Committee and the Operational Risk Committee) The AIG PC Environmental Working Group monitors risks and opportunities on an ongoing basis to guide environmental efforts, including identifying climate change related risks and opportunities

v) criteria for determining materiality/priorities:
Within each business unit, senior leaders and executives approve risk-taking policies and targeted risk tolerance within the framework provided by ERM  ERM supports AIG businesses and management in the embedding of enterprise risk management in all of our key day to day business processes and in identifying, assessing, quantifying, managing and mitigating the risks taken by us and our businesses
Accountability for the implementation and oversight of risk policies is aligned with individual corporate executives, with the risk committees receiving regular reports regarding compliance with each policy to support risk governance at our corporate level as well as in each business unit

vi) to whom are the results reported:
The Finance and Risk Management Committee of the Board of Directors periodically receive updates from AIGs Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) function and review the results of stress tests  Should a risk related to climate change be identified and become material, it would also be elevated through this established ERM process, with the results reported to the Board or Committee of the Board In addition, general accountability for the implementation and oversight of risk policies is aligned with individual corporate executives, with the risk committees receiving regular reports regarding compliance with each policy to support risk governance at our corporate level as well as in each business unit Progress and results of the Environmental Working Group are reported to the Chief Science Officer",2

American Mercury Insurance Company,"  Mercury takes into account known fundamentals in reviewing investments and management outlooks  Mercury may apply certain estimates from climate implications to investment forecasts that consider government-imposed barriers or selective market aids, as well as, free-market forces impacting positively or negatively companies or industries  Mercury managers do not explicitly consider the costs of carbon emissions for any specific company or investment but prefers to evaluate profit margins where the impact is already real or potentially an impact Climate change is a low risk consideration for most of Mercurys investments  The Company does not have a formal system in place to manage correlated climate risks between its underwriting and investments, but the investment managers have a general understanding of the business the Company conducts and the climate risks that can affect the Companys financial results  This understanding does impact the investment decisions to a certain extent",4
The Union Labor LIfe Insurance Company,"  The company currently does not have financial leverage, and has obtained access to capital if liquidity was to become an issue",2
American Economy Insurance Company," These models are continuously updated to incorporate the latest available scientific information related to severe weather perils, and are regularly updated with the most current policy-level exposure data to enable Liberty Mutual to monitor changes in severe weather catastrophe exposure Use of these models is incorporated into the underwriting process and aids in the development of risk selection guidelines In addition, catastrophe modeling is an important factor in establishing pricing differentials for individual risks as well as setting program rate structures These measures enable Liberty Mutual to effectively manage its natural catastrophe exposure portfolio

Liberty Mutual has a dedicated corporate Exposure Management unit which has the responsibility for estimating the potential financial impacts of the Companys catastrophe risk exposure This unit is a vital component of Liberty Mutuals ERM program and uses probabilistic catastrophe models as well as other means such as industry benchmarking, realistic disaster scenarios, and historical loss experience to estimate the potential impact of catastrophes

The Exposure Management unit includes a Catastrophe Research and Development team which evaluates the catastrophe models for alignment with the Liberty view of risk In particular, the team considers a range of event frequency and severity assumptions beyond those embedded in standard models and builds bespoke models using Libertys historical data, third party tools, publically available scientific data, and input from expert consultants The R&D team also regularly participates in industry conferences to keep current with the latest scientific understanding of climate change

Severe natural catastrophes are incorporated into a stress testing regime, which Liberty Mutual performs regularly as a component of its ERM program Stress testing ensures that the Company understands in detail the financial impacts (earnings, capital, and liquidity) of various deterministic stress scenarios or combinations of scenarios In this way the Company can ensure that its current portfolio of exposures does not result in a capital or liquidity impact that exceeds established tolerances

The Company actively monitors the latest developments related to climate change risks as respects liability lines, including with regard to potential application of various exclusions and other general liability policy provisions to climate change related claims",2
North American Title Insurance Company,"  The Companys risk management process is designed to identify material risks, including environmental risks  Should climate change be identified as a material risk, it would be assessed and managed through the Companys normal risk management process",2
Cigna Life Insurance Company of New York," Additionally, increases in energy and fuel costs may result in broader inflationary pressures from our suppliers 

We manage risks associated with energy and fuel costs through (1) our emissions reduction projects and (2) tracking and monitoring our progress toward energy reduction targets

To manage progress against our 2020 emissions reduction targets, we utilize a proprietary technology data management portal and utility tool to aggregate data for all the sustainability program efforts The utility tool provides a detailed dashboard of energy cost, consumption and variance across our real estate portfolio  in addition to ENERGY STAR® ratings  Cigna currently has 34 sites enrolled in the US Environmental Protection Agencys ENERGY STAR® program Additionally, all 12 Cigna office locations in the United Kingdom hold ISO 50001 Energy Management System Accreditations

From 2016-2018, we have invested approximately $375 million in completed projects to help make the buildings in our global real estate portfolio more energy efficient Please note that this investment figure largely represents HVAC system replacements that were undertaken as part of our comprehensive, multi-year renovation at corporate headquarters


Risk: Tropical cyclones (hurricanes and typhoons)Increases in the frequency and severity of extreme weather events, such as hurricanes and typhoons, could impact our business services distribution capacities, and may cause damage to physical assets    

Cigna is committed to excellence in helping our customers enhance and extend their lives and protect their financial security Such a commitment requires that we be prepared to provide our services and offer our products virtually without fail  Cigna's Customer Disaster Response also may need to make temporary policy changes, such as waiving various medical requirements, refilling prescriptions and expanding its help line, to proactively address customer service issues and provide personal assistance and support for all affected by a disaster       

Additionally, Cignas Employee Assistance Program (EAP) may open its telephone lines to offer members of the impacted communities access to trained clinicians via the telephonic EAP services, regardless if callers have Cigna EAP or not The EAP may also offer immediate access to on-site Critical Incident Services (CISD) support for Cigna clients

Management methods include the following:  (1) Cignas Business Continuity Planning and Data Center Recovery plans sets forth procedures for data recovery, continuation of business functions and the use of supporting technology to recover critical business operations in the event of hurricanes and other unexpected disruptions The plans are updated and documented annually Cignas data center recovery plans are tested routinely with end-user evaluations of the restored systems as part of the testing protocol  (2) Cignas critical applications run in hardened sites protected by an emergency generator Weve also repatriated core elements of our recovery capability including infrastructure to recover the top prioritized business functions and related computer applications through data and server replication  (3) To support clients, we have an online Disaster Resource Center, which is updated to offer resources specific to an area and incident Paired with an intimate knowledge of the provider network, Our Employee Assistance Consultant team area trained to respond quickly in the event of hurricanes  (4) We also obtain insurance and make investments to protect our facilities from hurricane risk    

These management methods have not reduced the likelihood of this risk, however; we believe that these methods have reduced this risks potential magnitude over the next 1-7 years

Risk: ReputationCorporate reputation on performance related to environmental responsibility, particularly on issues related to climate change, is increasingly important to our corporate clients as evidenced by the frequent occurrence of sustainability questions on RFPs for potential corporate clients and RFIs from existing ones Also, our reputation on performance related to climate change issues is becoming increasingly important to our employees, investors and other stakeholders

Management methods include the following: (1) Guided by our Strategic Sustainability Performance Plan, we make continued investments to support our energy strategy and 2020 emissions reduction targets; (2) In 2018, we had our Scope 1 and 2 emissions assured for the fourth consecutive year; (3) We closely monitor and respond to requests from corporate clients (including RFPs and RFIs) and requests related to climate change and corporate responsibility; (4) We gather and report on performance data both internally and externally; and (5) We also engage stakeholders, employees and corporate employer clients to enhance continuous improvement in the implementation of sustainability programs, which include our GreenSTEPS employee engagement program and focus groups, surveys and interviews conducted as part of a multi-faceted materiality exercise currently in process

We believe that  if Cigna did not engage in these current management methods - both the likelihood and magnitude of this risk over the next 1-3 years would be higher   However, we acknowledge the importance of continuously improving and responding to evolving stakeholder concerns and expectations to reduce the likelihood and potential magnitude of this risk

Liberty Mutual Insurance Company,"  Through its efforts, Liberty Mutual has earned LEED certification for seven buildings and ENERGY STAR labels for eight buildings Liberty Mutual actively participates in industry organizations resulting in use of best practices through data sharing and benchmarking   

To meet the guidelines for these standards, the company applies a wide range of energy efficiency strategies including the addition of energy-efficient bulbs that use under one watt of energy per square foot, automatic flush toilets and automatic water spouts, lighting control systems that turn lights off after business hours in all common hallways, and occupancy sensors that control lights in offices and conference rooms  

Liberty Mutuals focus on energy reduction initiatives is ongoing and with a continued strong focus on implementing building operating best practices, the company continues to drive down its overall energy consumption across its owned building portfolio    

As it builds new and retro-fits existing buildings to LEED standards, Liberty Mutual mandates that all construction contractors on its work sites follow indoor air quality guidelines and practices  Examples include using recycled/recyclable carpet, low VOC (volatile organic compounds) adhesives, sealants, and paints  With continuous improvements over time, Liberty Mutuals home office headquarters has received the LEED EB Gold certification in 2011 Liberty Mutuals new 22-story Boston office building is designed to achieve LEED Silver certification and will be nearly 20 percent more energy efficient than a typical large modern office building 

To improve the environmental impact of its daily operations, the company looks for small changes that will make a significant long-term impact  Activities such as working with contracted cleaning companies to ensure they follow environmentally-friendly procedures such as recycling plastic cleaning product containers and having the cleaners change from mops to microfiber products to use fewer chemicals in the cleaning process Another activity that further reduces energy usage and improves indoor air quality is the replacement of existing vacuum units with backpack vacuum cleaners, which are more efficient and have better dust control

As an insurance company Liberty Mutual produces large amounts of paperwork, therefore the companys Records Management department works closely with Liberty Mutuals record storage vendor to shred and recycle files eligible for destruction  In 2012, the company destroyed and recycled approximately 17,500 cartons of archived records  Through its secure shredding program, Liberty Mutual recycled an additional 79 million pounds of paper, which saved 67,000 trees and reduced landfill by approximately 12,000 cubic yards

Liberty Mutual has taken a leadership role in establishing compliance with office supply order minimums, which cut down on emissions by reducing the number of deliveries required to service its account  In 2012, this program reduced the companys greenhouse gas emissions (CO2 equivalents) by 141,121 lbs  Furthering its office supply recycling initiative, Liberty Mutual continued its company-wide campaign to use recycled paper, which saved the equivalent of 1,080 trees in 2012, and its recycled toner program for all eligible printers to both cut down on the amount of plastic produced and reduce expenses  

Extending energy conservation beyond the office, over 98 percent of Liberty Mutuals automotive fleet consists of PZEV (partial zero emission vehicle) and flex-fuel vehicles  In ongoing efforts to improve safety and reduce operating expenses, Liberty Mutual is piloting the use of telematics in company vehicles  This initiative will allow the company t manage fuel consumption on a per vehicle basis, in efforts to reduce carbon emission  The company received the 2011 Sustainability Award from the National Association of Fleet Administrators (NAFA) in recognition of its efforts to reduce consumption of fuel through changes in driver behavior in addition to the selection of alternative fuel vehicles Liberty Mutual was also the recipient of Automotive Fleet magazines 2009 Environmental Leader Award

HM Health Insurance Company,"  Climate change risks are embedded in many company processes and are managed like other risks, from inherent risks of underwriting exposures, facilities management and investment risks  The company has taken an active role in considering its impact on the environment and has taken steps to lessen any negative impacts to the environment or climate change With respect to investment management, the Companys investment portfolio may be impacted due to climate change or related activities and this is one of many factors that may be considered in investment decisions  Climate change has not been formally imbedded into investment policies or processes",1
Metropolitan Tower Life Insurance Company,"  As a result, catastrophic losses from these perils in the future may be greater than those in the past due to climate change  

MetLife utilizes three independent catastrophe models in its risk analysis The starting point for using the models is having accurate property locations Almost all of the property insured by MetLife is geocoded to a street location  The Company reviews both Long Term (historical hurricanes) and Near Term (hurricanes representing the next five years of expected activity under a warm sea surface assumption) results, with and without demand surge and with and without storm surge, using each of the three models Results are produced for five separate and distinct hurricane regions The Company reviews results for deterministic events, those that have occurred in the past, as well as stochastic events for high return periods such as the 1 in 100-year, 1 in 200-year, 1 in 250-year, 1 in 500-year, 1 in 1000-year, and 1 in 2000-year probabilities  Most, if not all, of these events produce higher losses than those observed in past known storms  The Company manages to conservative return periods and purchases property catastrophe reinsurance based on the more conservative Near Term expected losses
 
Often, MetLife performs stress testing by evaluating the impact of past known significant events (eg, Hurricane Katrina or Hurricane Andrew) on the current book of business as well as modeling the impact of past known storms on other nearby areas (eg, modeling the what if scenario of Hurricane Katrina making landfall at other points on the Gulf coast) The Company also reviews the impact of various size hurricanes making landfall at various points on the coast (eg, modeling of the financial impact at every category at 10 mile increments along various points of the coast in the Northeast and Gulf, its two largest hurricane exposure zones)  Results are evaluated and considered in the purchase of reinsurance

For tornado and hail events, the Company reviews tornado/hail model results in combination with exposure concentration information and historical loss data to identify areas within states where spread of risk metrics may be changing  Concentration analysis identifies areas in tornado/hail zones that may be impacted the most by individual or possibly even several major tornadoes from the same storm  Stress tests are performed on the areas in tornado/hail zones with the greatest total insured value in small geographic areas Results are evaluated and considered in the purchase of reinsurance  

In addition to modeling, as stated above, MetLife addresses climate risk throughout its global portfolio The most substantial business decisions made for integrating climate change into MetLifes business strategy are the companys energy and GHG emissions reduction targets and climate change considerations in the insurance products provided to customers These decisions have been influenced by both the need to preserve natural resources and the potential risk of future climate change related natural disasters, respectively 

As a company, MetLife has strong risk management programs and procedures built into its businesses to evaluate and mitigate various types of risk The impact of climate change remains one of the many risks that are considered in investment decisions  In addition, MetLife has internal policies and procedures to foresee, manage and mitigate risks and events related to climate change MetLife has a Global Crisis Management Team in place in order to oversee all aspects of a crisis situation  Across its global enterprise, MetLife recognizes and implements site-specific risk mitigation and action plans at each of its individual global offices MetLife's Global Crisis Management appoints Local Crisis Management Teams to oversee risk and crisis management efforts within a country, geographic area or location and works closely with its property management partners to coordinate responses

Enterprise Risk Management processes:
As noted in responses to prior questions, we have an Enterprise Risk Management process which looks at all material risks, including risks posed by climate change

Investment Management:
We consider correlated insurance exposures when making bond investment selections to ensure that we are not overly exposed to environmental occurrences in any one geographic territory from both an operational business (underwriting) and investment perspective   

Additionally, we consider the impact of climate change when assessing the financial risk parameters of certain sectors, such as utilities, as well as investment classes such as corporate bonds  

Increasing internal expertise:
We gather input from government agencies, reinsurance partners and industry groups We balance predicting risk with rigorous validation efforts after catastrophic events, auditing losses and comparing them with our pre-event risk assessments to inform future policies and business strategies 

For example, Chubb Loss Control Services conducted a detailed loss analysis to examine the impact of present and future climate change on the frequency and severity of natural hazards such as wind and rain, which led to the development of new risk evaluation guidelines, forms and training for field staff At our Loss Control University, we have expanded training to recognize the unique CleanTech exposures and promote solutions

Catastrophe Modeling:
We evaluate changes in catastrophe risk modeling and the subsequent impact on our existing book We use catastrophe modeling to understand and balance potential perils and risk exposure against our capacity Using catastrophe models, we asses risk scenarios at multiple time scales

Underwriting Management:
We use a risk concentration management tool to monitor/control accumulations of potential losses in geographic areas exposed to weather-related risks and changing weather patterns 

Steps taken to manage exposure to weather-related risk include:
	reviewing the catastrophe model projections; 
	reviewing reinsurance terms and limits; 
	limiting underwriting exposure in peak zones  
	reviewing and modifying our underwriting appetite and/or pricing and 
	encouraging our customers to take loss mitigation steps

Business Continuity Planning:
We have a multi-discipline business continuity planning team to assess and plan for the potential disruption of business operations due to a weather-related event

Engaging Key Constituencies:
As detailed in Question 7, we engage with key constituencies to facilitate their understanding of climate change and its potential impact on our business",7
Safe Auto Insurance Copany,"  However, as a non-standard private passenger automobile insurer, the impact is directly tied to specific weather events in specific localities  So, to that extent, we do have processes for the impact of climate change on our business",2
Crum & Forster Indemnity Company," Climate change poses a risk in terms of increase claims activity and loss potential Coverages that are most exposed, but are not limited to climate change are: D&O, Commercial General Liability, Errors & Omissions, Environmental, and Property  

D&O:  There is the risk that companies who delay taking action on climate change, or are inadequately prepared, could be sued by their investors Directors and Officers may be liable for incurring higher costs as a consequence of unduly delaying emissions reductions, thereby damaging their companys reputation and failing to disclose investment-relevant information The Company has nominal exposure and typically avoids writing this coverage

Commercial General Liability (CGL):  There is concern that bodily injury or property damage from greenhouse gas emission may be covered under a CGL policy The Supreme Court has ruled that greenhouse gas emissions are pollutants subject to the regulation of the Environmental Protection Agency Insurance Services Office pollution exclusions are generally attached on CGL policies for manufacturing risks 

Errors & Omissions: In the event of failures to infrastructure and buildings due to extreme weather conditions, the work of professional advisors may be scrutinized for not properly accounting for climate change in their design and development The Companys E&O portfolio consists predominantly of Accountants and Lawyers The Company has a very small number of policies for architects, surveyors, engineers and planners

Environmental Liability:  The Company understands that extreme weather events from climate change may lead to seepage from tanks and industrial sites 1-in-100 year flood plains and distance from rivers and other water sources are considered in underwriting these types of risks  In addition, oil and gas exploration and extraction classes are avoided Approximately less than 3% of the Pollution legal liability portfolio consists of landfills 

Property: There is significant risk of property damage from higher sea levels caused by climate change  Most of the Companys property policies generally exclude flood coverage and, when it is included, accounts are carefully underwritten with distance to coast and flood zone evaluated Climate Change is factored in the catastrophe modeling The Company has evaluated the impact of climate change based on near and long term frequency in the Gulf of Mexico, Florida, in the North Atlantic Basin, and hail states such as Colorado and Texas, which have the potential to be heavily impacted  In addition, the Company purchases property catastrophe reinsurance of $515 million excess of $50 million 

Travel: There is potential for losses from trip cancellation due to increase in frequency and severity of extreme weather conditions  The Company charges a premium for trip cancellation coverage and mitigates this exposure through the purchase of reinsurance

Business Interruption:  Climate change can potentially impact supply change demand in terms of contingent business interruption  The Company limits exposure to contingent business interruption coverage

The Companys business is diversified across the US, the largest state being New York (12% of total gross written premium as of 12/31/20)   However, the US is exposed to climate and environmental changes, natural perils such as earthquake, hurricanes, floods and availability of water supplies, along with the possibility of pandemics and terrorist acts   The Companys catastrophe management strategies are designed to mitigate its exposure  Through a combination of reinsurance, underwriting controls and careful tracking of exposures, supported by technology, the Company is focused on effectively managing risks This ensures that net catastrophe exposures are within Corporate risk tolerances and rating agency requirements In addition, the catastrophe risk tools are reviewed and validated",3

Assurants Chief Strategy Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Communication & Marketing Officer, who each report directly to our CEO, and Global Head of Risk oversee functions responsible for climate-related actions, policies and risk mitigation and management 

Climate-related issues are monitored by the Reinsurance Risk Committee (RRC), which reports into the Business Risk Committee (BRC), and subsequently the F&R Committee through regular updates from the Global Head of Risk on risk appetite related to reinsurance, changes to catastrophic risk, and material issues in catastrophe prone areas where Assurant plans to take on business The BRC, which is chaired by our Global Head of Risk and includes senior members of risk management, all the Business Unit Leaders and leaders of all the functional support areas of the Company, is responsible for the interdisciplinary oversight of business unit and enterprise risks and the design, management and recommendation of the risk appetite framework and limits The BRC reports and provides regular updates to the ERC The RRC, which reports to the BRC, focuses on the insurance risk across the enterprise and approves the use of reinsurance to mitigate these risks 

Our risk committees integrate social and environmental factors into their practices by monitoring relevant potential long-term concerns that could impact our business, such as climate change When the committees identify long-term risks, they work with other company functions to implement necessary programs and processes Effective enterprise risk management is crucial in the allocation of climate-related risks in our business

Additionally, a cross-enterprise Assurant CSR/ESG Governing Oversight Committee identifies, reports and recommends actions related to climate matters on a quarterly basis as part of the companys CSR/ESG Dashboard, which is shared with the companys Management Committee This board and process includes four members of Assurants Management Committee, among other functional leaders and subject matter experts representing Risk Management, Corporate Social Responsibility, Investor Relations, Legal, Human Resources, Innovation and Customer Experience areas

Title Resources Guaranty Company,  Property and casualty insurance companies would have more risk than title insurance,7
Minnesota Life Insurance Compan,"  is headquartered in downtown St Paul, MN In 2009, Securians 401 Building was the first commercial office building in the St Paul and Minneapolis central business districts to earn the impressive LEED certification for Existing Buildings LEED certification is the most rigorous  and most difficult  standard of achievement, given only to the worlds greenest, energy efficient, high performing buildings 

In 2010, Securian received the Sustainable St Paul Award in 2010 for protecting and restoring the environment in the city Our sustainable practices include: 

	Cleaning products and processes that comply with strict environmental and safety standards, sanitizing our buildings to protect health without affecting indoor air quality or harming the environment 
	A combination of smart and manual lighting controls for optimal energy effectiveness 
	Optimizing hardware configuration, monitoring electrical consumption and using energy efficient methods to heat and cool servers 
	Heating and cooling our downtown campus with a locally produced, renewable energy source 
	Extensive material recycling and reclamation programs, from paper and plastic to kitchen grease Office-grade paper is shredded by a secure recycler, pulped and reprocessed 
	Participating in equipment recycling programs to keep obsolete or toxic equipment out of landfills 

Securian also supports sustainable commuting by providing: 

	Bike racks and showers provided for associates and tenants who bike to work 
	Discounted bus passes for associates 
	Vanpool Commuter Check payroll deduction program 

Securian encourages its associates to: 

	Reduce paper waste by printing on both sides of the paper and using electronic forms or PDF files when sharing documents 
	Turn off supplemental lighting when away from desk and switch off the lights in conference rooms 


Finally, Securian purchases heating and cooling services from District Energy St Paul (DESP), the largest hot water district heating system in the United States, which leads the industry in technology integration targeted to improve the efficiency and environmental profile of the system and its users   Highlights of DESPs services are:

	In its 30 years of operation, DESPs heating system operates at twice the efficiency of the former steam district heating system while using the same amount of fuel  
	Carbon emissions for the overall system have been cut in half, while the system size has almost tripled  A major component of this efficiency is the incorporation of combined heat and power as the primary heat provider to the system  This has also allowed the incorporation of approximately 250,000 tons of biomass each year, sourced from local wood residues and forestry residuals  This has resulted in significant carbon reductions per unit of energy for each customer  
	The profile of the energy from the combined heat and power facility is 1984 tons/MWhr and DESPs 2014 goal is to reach 0185 tons/MWhr
	The integration of combined heat and power for the system allows two energy products (heat and electricity) to be generated from a single source, increasing fuel efficiency, reducing costs for end users, and reducing carbon profiles in both energy sectors  
	The combined heat and power plant has also reduced sulfur dioxide and particulate emissions, carbon dioxide emissions, and the use of oil, natural gas and coal 
	In 2010, DESP also integrated the nations largest solar hot water installation  The carbon footprint from the high-performance solar thermal installation resulted in carbon emission reductions of approximately 460,000 pounds in 2012  
	DESPs cooling system has also reduced the customers environmental profile  The integration of district cooling significantly reduced the use of chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) refrigerants in customer buildings and has reduced peak electricity usage through the incorporation of thermal storage
	DESPs system utilizes a fiber optic meter data collection system that is one of the most advanced in the industry  This system provides DESP with data to enable its acclaimed customer service team to help optimize building performance and provides customers with increased information to manage their building performance to meet or exceed efficiency standards

Tokio Marine American Insurance Company,"S Tokio Marine Group Companies (""Tokio Marine Group"") are part of Tokio Marine Holdings Inc's (""TMH"") worldwide initiative to become carbon neutral (net zero emissions) Carbon emissions, as measured by energy usage and paper consumption, have been assessed since 2009 ""Protecting the Earth"" is a core theme of TMH and its subsidiaries We constantly undertake steps toward global environmental protection
by providing products and services that are designed to mitigate or adapt to climate
change, by realizing a reduction in our environmental footprint and becoming carbon
neutral in our business operations, and by conducting global environmental protection
activities that include mangrove planting The Tokio Marine Group worldwide has achieved carbon neutral status in its domestic and overseas business operations since 2013 In addition, Tokio Marine Group companies worldwide contribute to global environmental protection by promoting environmental awareness and education as part of our on-going corporate social responsibility efforts to contribute to our local communities

The Tokio Marine Group has adopted the following practices to assess and reduce or
mitigate emissions in the organizations:  Going paperless and/or reducing paper
consumption Many offices have switched to printer paper made from recycled content
for use when printing is necessary  Purchasing office supplies that are made from
green or recycled materials  Transitioning from water bottle coolers to more energy
efficient, bottle-less water cooler systems and utilizing reusable bottles in place of
plastic water bottles or Styrofoam cups Replacing personal printers with shared, more energy-efficient multi-functional devices  Redesigning workstations to reduce energy costs  Establishing recycling programs for paper, plastic, light bulbs, toner and ink cartridges and cans and bottles at offices nationwide  Encouraging carpooling, vanpooling and other ride share options as well as the use of public transportation  Encouraging bike to work programs Replacing face-to-face meetings by using video conference equipment, WebEx and other technologies Participation in TMH's 100 year commitment to the re-forestation of the mangrove trees by having employees take part in planting mangrove trees on plantations in Southeast Asia Becoming LEED certified in some locations  Utilizing timers on lights to reduce energy consumption The Tokio Marine Group has also taken steps to increase environmental education and awareness among its employees Community outreach events are regularly organized to demonstrate the Tokio Marine Group's commitment to reducing environmental impact Initiatives included: 
Lunch-and-Learn Events: Representatives from local environmental non-profits invited
to speak to employees about areas of environmental concern such as sto1m water management, clean air and pollution and energy conservation  Employee Volunteer Events: A number of company-sponsored environmental volunteer events have been conducted Since 2012, the Tokio Marine Group has had an environmental corporate social responsibility coordinator on staff  Philadelphia Insurance Companies (PIC) established ""GreenPHLY"", a team effort by employees to preserve the environment and mitigate the carbon footprint l'IC developed the ""GreenPHLY EnvironmentalPriority Action Plan"" which established the company's environmental goals and objectives for the future The plan is focused on three (3) environmental priority areas including carbon footprint reduction, environmental education and awareness and community outreach In support of carbon footprint reduction, carbon emissions, as measured by energy usage and paper consumption, are tracked using the Hara environment management system software PIC has purchased green power
equivalent to 100% of the company's electricity use in its offices nationwide since
2013 The purchase of certified, 100% wind generated renewable energy certificates
in 2015 displaced 3,5639 metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions, which is equivalent
to taking 753 cars off the road for a year

This green power purchase enabled PIC to join the EPA's Green Power Partnership
(GPP) and Leadership Club The OPP assists organizations in procuring electricity
generated from renewable sources and recognizes Partners' green power leadership
In2014, PIC was awarded a US EPA Green Power Leadership Award for Green Power
Purchasing In2015, PIC launched a campaign in partnership with the Arbor Day
Foundation to replant trees in forests nationwide that have been devastated by
wildfires PIC funded the planting of 80,000 trees in the 2015-2016 planting season
and has renewed this commitment for the 2016-2017 planting season

Knowing that the data centers consume a substantial amount of energy, more than
any other area of the business, the Tokio Marine Group has focused on decreasing
energy consumption in that area The Tokio Marine Group partnered with vendors

switches which helps reduce the total power draw",0
Northwestern Long Term Care Ins. Co.,"  With respect to any physical or natural environmental risks that have been attributed to climate change, the Company has created an organization and supporting tools and processes to respond effectively to any type of significant incident that poses a risk to its business, including: 
	
	Threatening severe weather,
	Facility disasters or other denial of facilities,
	Information technology failures,
	Violent acts,
	Public health disasters, and
	Natural disasters

Other risks for life insurers that have been associated with climate change, such as increased risk of extreme weather events, increased or decreased mortality, changes in morbidity patterns, or changes in customer behavior, will take many years to manifest themselves in reliably measurable ways  Nevertheless, as described in our other responses, the Company is confident that its risk management process addresses these risks

Berkley National Insurance Company," Information is communicated via loss control surveys, tips brochures, newsletters and disaster planning material, weather alert postings on Company websites, State Department of Insurance bulletins communicated directly to insureds or through producers, webinars and training opportunities  Tips on green construction, energy efficiency, influences of weather and other related topics are available via their social media pages (namely Twitter and LinkedIn) These loss control services provide insureds with practical tools needed to handle potential climate hazards in the best way possible and to mitigate the size/severity of the loss 
Distribution of training materials to policyholders is also communicated in an ecofriendly and cost effective manner through the use of loss prevention specialists who train insureds to present Safety Meetings to their employees as it relates to high wind, changing road conditions, and winter driving conditions Additional training is also offered to those same policyholders via on demand videos and the training extends to cover any driver training that might be requested by the policyholder Online training allows the company to operate in a paperless environment, eliminating the need for physical training materials and provide the training from remote locations to avoid traveling long distances to do in-person training
Certain risk management services are offered that include roof inspection during risk surveys to help determine the integrity of the roof covering, erosion/landslide risks and brush fire/forest fire precautions and as a result of these types of inspection, information is communicated to the customer to help anticipate and reduce risk through increased knowledge Allowing the policyholder to be proactive in preventing the likelihood of a loss A related measure offers aircraft hurricane relocation reimbursement expense coverage to named insureds where the policy coverage reimburses a portion of eligible expenses incurred for relocating the aircraft to a safer location when a threat of a hurricane arises Companies encourage their insureds to store certain scheduled property, such as artwork, off the ground and allow for it to be moved quickly in the event of a storm  Finally, one company initiates risk management discussions after claims investigations or inspections to review any deficiencies in owned property and assist insureds in mitigating reoccurring exposure to losses  
An additional incentive used is the promotion of policyholder loss mitigation by offering green coverage endorsements for property, inland marine and equipment breakdown to policyholders to encourage conversion to green products and materials Some Companies are in the process of adopting rating organizations green building endorsements with all of their property filings These endorsements support the green initiative and promote the use of environmentally friendly products that may reduce factors contributing to potential climate change related events 
A company providing coverages to publicly traded or large privately held companies, works closely with these insured entities who are by nature, complex, sophisticated operations already heavily focused on risk management, including climate change initiatives and subject to SEC regulations requiring mandatory reporting and disclosure requirement with respect to climate change issues to assist in managing these exposures  Additionally there are protocols that have emerged for voluntary reporting of environmental matters established by nongovernmental entities including disclosure of information regarding environmental, sustainability, corporate social responsibility and more recently climate change and greenhouse gas emissions  
The pressure to comply with these voluntary disclosures arise  from initiatives to  create  awareness  among  the  public  and  institutional  investors  to  compel companies to disclose environmental risk and impacts, and as a result to change their behavior to avoid future negative disclosure For these insured entities, disclosure takes on a broader process than simply complying with SEC requirements 
Because of the interrelationships of the stakeholders in the financial and economic marketplace, environmental disclosure is linked with environmental risk management Disclosure decisions are linked to the management of the risks that require disclosure Sustainability and social responsibility are key issues for large, sophisticated risks, and climate change is an important focus of socially responsible investors 
Finally one company is specifically focused on insuring operations in the renewable energy sector, which supports the growth of renewable energy in the US  By insuring these operations the company makes a positive contribution to the growth of operations that produce energy from non-fossil fuel sources, which reduces greenhouse gas emissions associated with the production of energy from fossil fuel sources

Foremost Property & Casualty Insurance Company," Regulatory risks as diverse as insurance regulatory obligations, emissions caps, base load management requirements, and building code requirements could impact the insurance business Regulation, as well, can have the unintended consequence of masking risk based price signals and could cause stakeholders to increase climate related risk  rather than manage and reduce such risks For example, subsidizing property insurance premiums, or flood insurance premiums or providing insurance or agreements to re-build in regularly eroded coastal locations or high risk fire areas could cause increase of building in such locations in a manner economically inconsistent with the physical risks presented by climate change

Regulatory uncertainty and regulation that is not economically well-grounded can create additional risk for both insurers and society Even where public policies are well grounded in sound economic policy, multi-state and nationally active insurers will likely be required to address potentially disparate and conflicting climate policies and rules and bear the associated costs

These generally complex issues involving the interplay of new requirements within existing legal structures create unique risks; results of the same public policy will likely be different when applied in different jurisdictions - unless the results of interplay are completely and accurately analyzed in the development of such policy

Potential unintended negative consequences of regulatory action could pose a challenge for the industry, such as where the true economic cost of new legislation has not been well thought through or where the new legislation results in a disproportionate allocation of costs of climate related risk In addition, competing requirements could mean that compliance in one jurisdiction may not satisfy other jurisdictions, thus creating duplicative or additive expenditures in the development of adaptive risk management solutions without demonstrable economic or social benefit Additionally, regulatory actions may restrict a company from making needed changes to its pricing or prompt litigation which could put a financial strain on the organization

As the insurance industry faces regulatory risk, they face legal risk as well  Climate-related legislation that is not well-crafted may create incentives for lawsuits in some jurisdictions Even in the absence of new laws, there have already been and may continue to be attempts to use existing laws to bring more climate change-related litigation against sovereign entities and companies in particular sectors

With respect to an insurers own operations and physical facilities, regulatory initiatives relating to emissions limits, transportation, water and energy use could impact office planning, employee commuting patterns and general resource usage Within Farmers, activities to help respond to these trends have begun, including telecommuting, meetings held via phone, video and webinar, recycling and other environmentally-friendly practices

Farmers also has exposure to physical risks of climate change with respect to its own operations and as a result of exposures of its insureds assumed by Farmers though insurance policies As outlined in the previous section, the physical risks impacting Farmers customers, as a result of climate change, may generate higher volatility in claims

A growing consensus among climate change experts suggests that changing weather patterns present risks of concern related to climate change Direct impacts such as increased frequency and severity of precipitation events, droughts, and wildfire are among the multiplicity of potential conditions that could impact ultimate loss events for insureds The risk of these events could also pose a financial strain on the organization Improved resilience and customers risk management actions continue to be significant foci of Farmers The potential indirect physical and public health impact, such as increased frequency of widespread disease events and localized food and water shortages, may also affect many areas of property and casualty insurance Such physical risks have both obvious and subtle consequences for insurers These vulnerabilities, risks, and consequences are considered as an integrated part of the underwriting process in a manner appropriate given the tenor of the insurance instrument and the manifestation of variability, risk management vulnerability reductions and impacts

With regard to the insurers' own operations or investments, insurers, like their customers, have facilities and operations that are exposed to physical risks of climate change described above Climate change (severe drought) may drive people/employees away from California, which could be damaging to a Southern California based company

Please note that the Companies have approximately 20% of their total writings in Property and the remaining 80% of their total writings are for lines other than property; thus the business focus is on liability lines of insurance Additionally the Companies write almost entirely commercial lines risks rather than personal lines risks 

Perils considered when assessing the potential risks posed by climate change include:
 Hurricane and tropical storm
 Tornado
 Flood
 Drought
 Wildfire

Hurricane
North Atlantic hurricanes and tropical storms typically impact states between Texas and Maine The Group identifies and models its hurricane risks in 23 states that could be affected by these perils, and on an annual basis has its exposures modeled in an alternative vendor model with a broader set of states

As noted in section 3, over the period from 1880 onwards there is a slight downward trend in the number of landfalling hurricanes Some of the weather and climate conditions that make it easier for hurricanes to form in the Atlantic Basin also appear to impair the likelihood of landfall For example, hurricanes that form further from land are less likely to maintain their structure long enough to make landfall as damaging events In the long term the current consensus view is that there will be fewer hurricanes, but that these will be of greater intensity However the same science that provides this long term view also indicates it will be many decades before we see the these changes

The Group closely monitors the forecast numbers of tropical storms and hurricanes for each season, investigates all available vendor models, and tests alternative assumptions on the potential frequency and severity of such events

Each individual property location is assessed for catastrophe risk, with particular focus on those nearest the coast and / or near river estuaries

Tornado
As noted in section 3, over the period from 1950 onwards the number of tornadoes is not increasing In older calendar years there was significant under-reporting of the weakest category of tornado (EF-0); if one considers all other tornado strengths there is no trend in the frequency of these events or in the number falling into each strength category EF-1 to EF-5

When tornado insured losses are normalized for changes in exposures (for example, the number and values of the buildings and contents, often in areas that were previously agricultural land), these too show no increasing trend

The Group models tornado losses in every state within the USA, and has also revalued the tornadoes reported by the ISO Property Claims Service (PCS) from 1950 onwards to allow for changes in exposure as an additional data source 

Flood
As noted in section 3, flood losses arising from river and surface water are decreasing as a percentage of GDP 
The majority of the property policies issued by the Group exclude losses covered by flood In those policies that do cover flood, many have flood sublimits

Drought & Wildfire
Drought and wildfire are strongly connected One study looking at data through to 2002 indicated that fully half the variability in wildfire (measured by acres burned) arises as a result of drought conditions
http://viewofficeappslivecom/op/viewaspx?src=http%3A%2F%2Ftiorg%2FFire%26droughtdoc

As noted in section 3, the current period of drought is not as severe as periods seen in the past Furthermore, there was a drought in the latter part of the 16th century that was far more severe than any subsequent drought in North America

The Group does not write the two business lines that would be most significantly impacted by drought (crop multi-peril) or by wildfire (homeowners) Consequently our losses arising from such events are minimal

Loyal American Life Insurance Company," The geographic areas considered includes all locations where our Company and its subsidiaries operate, with a focus on North America 

We consider a range of potential opportunities driven by physical climate risks, including changes in temperatures, precipitation patterns and sea levels Specifically, we consider the potential for changes in physical climate parameters to present a broader series of global public health challenges, such as those relating to (1) extreme weather events, (2) decreases in water supply, (3) heat exposure and (4) declining crop yields In the short-term, extreme weather events have been prioritized as our greatest physical risk

We also consider how changes in physical and transition risks could also influence a series of socioeconomic challenges and opportunities that would likely impact the delivery of healthcare Examples could include health and hygiene issues due to migration, malnutrition, and increases in respiratory, bronchial, water-borne and other diseases Additionally, we consider how these negative societal and environmental impacts could present opportunities where Cigna, in particular, could provide products and services to help respond to these changes in physical climate parameters across the markets we serve

Our risk assessment considers all geographic locations and markets where we operate in addition to potential new markets under evaluation Additionally, we consider global environmental and socioeconomic trends, which may impact the value of our assets in addition to revenue and costs in our target markets The criteria used to determine our priorities with regards to climate change risks and opportunities include the following factors: degree of potential regulatory, physical and other business impacts to Cigna In addition to engaging with our internal stakeholders to prioritize risks and opportunities, we also monitor the activities related to climate change risk among our key stakeholders, which include investors, corporate customers and industry peers 

For example, increasing energy efficiency at our facilities has been prioritized due to (1) cost savings and risk mitigation opportunities, (2) identified value to our stakeholders and (3) alignment with our mission and the increasingly globalized nature of our operations Based on our prioritization, we have a Strategic Sustainability Performance Plan in place that includes formal policies on energy and water consumption, and direct and indirect carbon dioxide emissions

We define risk as having a substantial financial and strategic impact using both qualitative and quantitative measures Qualitative measures consider correlations to our business model, mission and value chain Quantitatively, we generally consider a risk to be substantive based on a scenario where at least 1% of our net income could be impacted In 2018, this threshold was approximately $25 million

The Hanover American Insurance Co.,"  

Energy efficiency has always been an important area of focus for The Hanover More than 20 years ago, The Hanover began a journey to reduce its carbon footprint From an investment in ultra-efficient ice harvesting thermal storage to cool its buildings, to upgrading fan systems with high efficiency variable speed drive motors, installing continuous commissioning energy management systems, upgrading  much of its lighting to efficient LED lighting, the installation of white roofs on many buildings and recently completing a multi-million dollar project to replace over 300 windows with high efficiency, energy saving low-e double pane windows at its Headquarters facility, The Hanover has worked tirelessly to reduce its energy consumption The culmination of these and many other energy conservation projects have resulted in the achievement of the prestigious EPA Energy Star certification for the past ten consecutive years for The Hanovers owned properties This certification affirms top quartile performance in energy usage according to EPA guidelines 

The Hanover has also established a leadership position in the area of environmental responsibility For the past nine consecutive years, 100% of the electricity consumed at the 800K square foot HQ campus and a total of over 50% of the entire electricity demand across The Hanovers entire office portfolio is offset by certified Renewable Wind Energy Certificates In addition, for over a decade, The Hanover has worked diligently to improve and strengthen its Green Cleaning program This program improves indoor air quality, reduces water consumption and energy usage, and utilizes cleaning products that have minimal impact to the waste stream The Hanover also takes pride in its innovative and robust recycling and compost programs which year after year effectively diverts close to 40% of the total waste stream at its HQ facility away from landfills  

The Hanover recognizes the impact its employees have on the environment as they commute to and from work With this in mind, The Hanover has long supported the use of alternate forms of travel to reduce Greenhouse Gas emissions With the recognition that electric cars materially contribute to the reduction of carbon emissions and a healthier planet, we have invested in electric car charging stations for employees and visitors at our HQ facility With Massachusetts anticipating that 300,000 electric vehicles will be on the road by 2025, we are proud to help pave the way for widespread use of alternative fuel vehicles  The Hanover also supports employee flexible work arrangements, allowing many employees to work from home, further improving air quality and reducing traffic on our congested roadways For these efforts, in 2018, The Hanover earned the ECO Leadership award from Massachusetts Department of Transportation for delivering excellence in commuter options 

Beyond the measurable results above, each year The Hanover encourages active hands on employee participation by hosting an Employee Earth Day Celebration, to educate and showcase energy efficiency and environmental conservation This much-anticipated event includes interactive exhibits, booths and presentations by internal groups, vendors and other exhibitors that invest their time and energy to make ours a more energy efficient, green-friendly planet Employees are encouraged to attend the event, visit with the exhibitors, learn and become an active participant in reducing their carbon footprint not only at work, but in their homes and communities as well 

All of these efforts have a significant impact on our organization Most important, our sustainability efforts and programs make a meaningful impact in reducing The Hanovers carbon footprint We have also witnessed a significant reduction in energy consumption and experienced a material cost savings as a result of our efforts Finally, as we continue to strive to recruit the best talent in the industry, our sustainability practices have helped us attract more environmentally-conscious employees, especially early-in-career talent, who view sustainability as a baseline requirement for their employer, and will continuously challenge The Hanover to deliver even more going forward

Agri General Insurance  Company," We recognize that climate changes and weather patterns are integral to our underwriting process and we continually adjust our processes to address them This approach is intended to help ensure that losses are contained within our risk tolerance and appetite for individual product lines, businesses and Chubb as a whole Climate-related risks like flood and wildfire are continually monitored where exposure exists Extensive work has been done to understand the potential climate impacts to our view of risk as determined by the catastrophe models we use For example, we have stress tested our US hurricane model using IPCC scenarios

The consequences of climate change comprise myriad perils and hazards, and thus multiple risks Risk identification involves evaluation of the various risks via ERM to which Chubb is exposed as a result of the company's business profile and the external environment within which Chubb operates Risk assessment flows sequentially from risk identification and is performed by executive-level risk owners and business management Risk assessment occurs both on an ad-hoc basis as part of day-to-day activities and formally, with an annual analysis including key controls and emerging issues

The actual level and type of risk analysis employed in each situation depends on many factors: the nature of the risk, its materiality to Chubb, the quality of the data, the underlying facts and science and potential actions post-assessment Quantification typically involves an assessment of the severity and likelihood of occurrence, analysis of Chubbs exposures (underwriting limits deployed, counter-party exposure) relative to risk measures (earnings, capital, liquidity, industry market share) and other considerations such as collateral Accumulation and scenario analyses are supported by the latest claims, actuarial, CAT modeling, legal, investment, underwriting and emerging risk information

As part of its underwriting process, Chubb regularly applies exclusions, which depend on the specific conditions and circumstances of the risk being evaluated Those exclusions may reflect ESG-related considerations For example, Chubb is among the worlds largest global underwriters of environmental liabilities and pollution risks However, Chubbs underwriting in this business restricts its participation in certain industries, including mining operations, oil refining, pipeline and distribution operations and chemical manufacturing and distribution 

Chubb accounts for the potential impact of catastrophe and climate risks on the companys own facilities and operations Direct risk to Chubbs business operations exists if such weather events occur where Chubb has offices Severe weather events have tested Chubbs Business Continuity Program and, in those tests, operations have functioned effectively Chubbs risk analysis ranges from the known (based on definitive historical loss experience) to the hypothetical (based on a probable maximum loss calculation)

Through the use of catastrophe models, Chubb manages severe weather risk to indirect client exposures throughout the world Special emphasis is given to areas where Chubb has significant exposures and the inherent risk from extreme weather events  such as tropical cyclone and other windstorm  is deemed to be high, such as the coastal United States, Southeast Asia and UK/Europe To aid in prioritizing management focus on extreme weather events, each peril region is classified as either Tier 1, 2 or 3 according to the exposures and risk combination present Tier 1 regions are the highest priority areas for the company as they present the greatest risk profile and are the most carefully managed Tier 2 and 3 regions are also closely managed, at the regional and business unit level In addition to modeled peril regions, Chubb focuses on non-modeled perils, such as flood, which present a risk in many of the developing areas of the Chubb insurance portfolio We continue to invest in developing and refining tools to identify and track our exposures related to flood, given an increasing incidence in flood losses in our property insurance portfolio over the last decade

Chubb recognizes the reality of climate change and expects a transition over time to greater reliance on alternative and renewable fuel solutions to meet energy needs Making this transition necessarily involves planning and action by businesses, policymakers, investors and citizens In 2019, Chubb adopted a policy concerning thermal coal related underwriting and investment The company will not make new debt or equity investments in companies that generate more than 30% of revenues from thermal coal mining or energy production from coal The company will no longer underwrite the construction and operation of new coal-fired plants or new risks for companies that generate more than 30% of their revenues from coal mining or energy production from coal Insurance coverage for existing coal-plant risks that exceed this threshold will be phased out by 2022, and for utilities beginning in 2022 Advances in technology, including the development and commercialization of alternative and renewable sources of energy, is also essential to transitioning to a low-carbon economy As a leading provider of insurance for Clean Tech companies through their start-up, research and development, pilot projects and commercialization, Chubb supports the innovation and growth of businesses that help avoid emissions from fossil fuels Further, we are planning to increase our purchase of renewable energy as part of our greenhouse gas reduction goal

Lincoln Life Assurance Company of Boston," Does the company have a plan to assess, reduce or mitigate its emissions in its operations or organizations? If yes, please summarize 

Yes

Lincoln Life Assurance Company of Boston is a subsidiary of Lincoln National Corporation (LNC), and both companies utilize Lincoln Financial Group as their marketing name (Lincoln Financial or the Company)
A comprehensive greenhouse gas inventory, inclusive of some aspects of Scope 3 emissions, has been compiled annually since 2012 by Lincoln Financial Groups Office of Corporate Responsibility and the various administrative services teams responsible for operating and managing Lincolns facilities In 2015 Lincoln Financial Group set its first carbon emission reduction target to reduce its Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 20% per employee from a 2014 baseline by 2020 
Lincoln Financial Groups most significant sources of Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions are a result of its building operations From a building energy efficiency perspective, Lincoln Financial has a program dating back to 1972 to actively monitor and manage energy used in the facilities it owns and operates  The company has an ongoing commitment to evaluate and act on opportunities to improve energy efficiency in both the short and long term  For example, Lincoln Financial Group began a major renovation of its largest owned property, located on the three-building campus in downtown Greensboro, North Carolina This five-year project will completely transform 270,962 square feet of office space in the Elm Building Energy efficiency is a significant driving force behind the transformation the building will undergo over the next five years 
In 2019, we continued to make good on our commitment to care for the environment through company-wide goals as well as personal actions inside and outside the workplace

Conseco Life Insurance Company,"  However, climate change is considered along with other risks to the Company through its existing Enterprise Risk Management processes  As an insurer focused on supplemental health, annuities and life products, the Companys risks of climate change relate primarily to adverse impacts on morbidity and mortality rates  Changes in morbidity and mortality risks are monitored through existing enterprise risk management practices and considered in the Companys standard pricing and underwriting processes   

The Company recognizes that climate change may impact general economic conditions  Government policies to slow climate change (eg, setting limits on carbon emissions) may have an impact on sectors such as utilities, transportation and manufacturing  The analysis of investments held in these sectors includes the possibility of additional regulation  The Company manages its investment risks by maintaining a well-diversified portfolio, both by sector and geographically   The Company considers the effects of climate change on issuers of securities we hold and that we diversify our holdings to minimize the effects of climate change on any particular industry or geographic region

Technology Insurance Company,"  The company has an Emerging Risk Committee, which identifies new and changing risks to the business  Climate risk was identified and tracked through that committee  
On a quarterly basis, North American natural catastrophe exposures are monitored using the AIR model  Modelled results are based on warm sea surface temperatures (WSST), which recognize the impact of climate change on sea temperatures The modelled 1 in 250 catastrophe PMLs for property and workers compensation are monitored against board-approved risk appetites  In addition, we perform Lloyds Realistic Disaster Scenarios (RDS) to estimate the potential losses incurred from a variety of hypothetical disaster scenarios, using consistent and appropriate methods and assumptions  The RDS are produced for property and workers compensation books of business
Natural catastrophe stress is considered in the groups ORSA The post-stress Universal Bests Capital Adequacy Ratio (BCAR) is used to assess capital adequacy on a group level  The groups capital risk appetite is to maintain a Universal BCAR score at or above 5% at the 99th percentile which results in a BCAR assessment of Adequate
The catastrophe modeling team works closely with the underwriting, actuarial pricing and also the ceded reinsurance team to inform the groups reinsurance purchasing

First Symetra National Life Insurance Company of New York," We address potential impacts of climate change as part of our risk model, which draws on risk-based capital concepts In the model, risks are classified into four main categories:  Investment risks;  Pricing risks, including determination of adequate spreads or premiums, and estimation of claims, both expected and catastrophic;  Interest rate risk, including asset/liability duration matching exposures;  Other business risks, including business continuity, data security, and other operational risks The potential impact of climate change, such as hurricanes or natural disasters, is addressed in this model by reviewing geographic concentration in our investment and pricing risk assessments",1
Great American E & S Insurance Company," The Company generally seeks to reduce exposure to catastrophes through its underwriting guidelines and individual risk selection, including minimizing coastal exposures that could be more directly affected by climate change, and the purchase of reinsurance  Due to the diversification of the Companys business and its minimal catastrophe exposure, it does not believe climate change presently poses a material risk",3

"Columbia Mutual Insurance Company, Inc.","  Increased weather-related losses also have the potential to lead to higher claims costs due to a higher demand for replacement building materials, etc  Changing weather patterns have expanded geographically, and some of these areas and risks identified by the Company are as follows:

o	The Midwest has experienced a significant increase in the frequency and severity of weather-related claims in recent years  As a result, we have taken action to significantly reduce our personal property business in this region

o	Coastal Regions continue to experience ever-increasing risks of severe weather in the form of hurricanes  Our exposure in the coastal regions is not widespread, and should we expand our market, we will continue to diversify our book of business geographically to offset these increased risks

Further, regulatory and legislative changes related to climate issues also pose a potential threat to our operations  Specifically, mandates of coverage or restrictions on pricing that do not correlate directly to risk can increase the companys loss costs and reduce profit to untenable levels  Unexpected restrictions on underwriting actions following weather-related events also result in additional policyholder notices and actions that often lead to confusion and increase our cost of operations  The completion of duplicative surveys, data calls and other reports after weather-related events can also increase our cost of doing business",3

Arbella Insurance Group," In response, the company purchases a robust catastrophe reinsurance program with a well diversified roster of financially strong reinsurance companies to reduce its net exposure to severe weather events to an acceptable level of capital  In recognition of the more recent trend of an increase in frequency, the company also purchases reinsurance to limit its exposure to an aggregation of losses from multiple events in a single year  

To manage catastrophe exposure, underwriters utilize mapping software to verify the location of individual exposures  Coastal exposure growth is monitored on a quarterly basis and restricted coastal zones have been identified with targeted exposure level s and specific underwriting criteria/guidelines  Various windstorm and other deductibles are in place depending on location/distance from the coast to further mitigate exposure to severe weather

First Specialty Insurance Corporation,") as part of its risk management and underwriting process The company supplements this process with research into climate change and its economic impact 

Swiss Re's Sustainability unit coordinates our climate change engagement, including our program of climate risk research  

Swiss Res Catastrophe Perils unit includes experts in windstorm, tropical cyclone and flooding This unit is responsible for the design and maintenance of the company's natural catastrophe loss models and supports the assessment of climate related risks as part of the underwriting process for our insurance and reinsurance activities Guided by collaboration with leading scientific institutions, the latest scientific knowledge, and loss experiences the models are updated on a regular basis The company's risk and premium calculations are based on the probabilistic hazard models, which are based on historic events To ensure our models and pricing calculations remain accurate going forward in a changing climate, we have to make sure that we identify significant future trends in natural hazards, quantify their long term impact on insured losses and include findings in our risk models and underwriting processes

Understanding natural catastrophe risks and the impact of climate change is critical to cost our business accurately and to structure sound risk transfer solutions The damage caused by floods, storms, earthquakes and other natural disasters can affect millions of lives and the economies of entire countries In 2015, the total worldwide economic losses from natural and man-made catastrophes were estimated at USD 92 billion  of these, USD 37 billion were insured Having access to effective insurance protection against natural catastrophes creates significant benefits for our clients  as well as society at large In 2015, we received USD 26 billion of Property and Casualty (P&C) Reinsurance premiums for natural catastrophe covers (for losses larger than USD 20 million), which was equivalent to 17% of total premiums in this business segment 

Swiss Re's research on the economics of climate adaptation (ECA) has a specific focus on the impact of climate change on local economies The company completed two new ECA research projects in 2015, one for Barisal in Bangladesh and one for San Salvador in El Salvador More information on ECA may be found at http://wwwswissrecom/rethinking/climate_and_natural_disaster_risk/shaping_climate_resilient_developmenthtml This research has provided a valuable supply of data in support of our strategy to develop business with the private sector through the provision of innovative risk transfer products 
On the investment side, we screen our portfolio on a number of ESG factors, including climate change, and specifically carbon emissions, with the support of an external vendor regularly on an annual basis Additionally, we assess our portfolio on sector-driven carbon intensity, applying an internally-developed model The next step is to do a deep-dive analysis on the portfolio's inherent carbon emissions to get transparency and to better manage the risks and opportunities associated with climate change

LM General Insurance Company," This could result in an increase in both the magnitude and volatility of losses due to severe weather events Ensuring adequate pricing for natural catastrophe risks could become more challenging, particularly given the existing regulatory regime

Severe weather-related events of concern, such as hurricanes, severe thunderstorms, and tornados, are localized, short-term weather-related events that are a second order impact of a warming global climate While it is logical to assume that a warmer climate would increase the amount of atmospheric energy available for the formation of localized, short-term severe weather events, the precise impact to the frequency and severity of such events relative to historical levels is uncertain

The understanding of the impact of climate change on wildfires is still developing throughout the insurance industry, but warmer temperatures and drought are likely to create conditions for more and potentially larger fires New models are being developed along with the advancement in science on such climate effects 

Increases in property catastrophe risk associated with climate change will manifest themselves gradually over a period of many years (decades), while insurance policies are usually of one-year duration This allows Liberty Mutual the opportunity to adjust rates, coverages and underwriting guidelines as required in response to trends that demonstrate an increase in the frequency and/or severity of natural catastrophe events The Company will continue to closely monitor trends in catastrophe loss frequency and severity, and to employ the latest generation of computer modeling tools to estimate exposures to natural catastrophe events, adjust pricing, and revise underwriting guidelines as necessary 

Future pricing must be sufficiently flexible and continuously incorporate the latest trend data and scientific advances in catastrophe modeling to ensure adequate risk adjusted returns on capital A significant concern is the potential for a wide divergence in the future between the consensus view of natural catastrophe risk between insurers and the regulators with authority to approve changes to pricing Many current regulatory regimes do not allow sufficient flexibility to ensure that pricing is set at actuarially sound levels, and in effect set price controls that are slow to react to changes in risk levels Should the Company be unable to raise rates consistent with any increases in natural catastrophe risk, the only viable strategic option may be to significantly restrict the amount of business written in certain markets, or possibly to exit certain markets altogether

The geographical areas impacted by climate change risk are generally those that are currently at the greatest risk for the natural catastrophe perils described above (eg, the East Coast and Gulf for hurricanes; the Central and Southern US for tornados and severe thunderstorms; and the Western US for wildfires) Any increase in the frequency and severity of natural catastrophes may expand the boundaries of the geographic areas that are susceptible to each peril, but the areas indicated above are likely to continue to be of highest risk

Greater New York Mutual Insurance Company," This is because we seek to maintain a diversified portfolio, with a large percentage of the portfolio invested in obligations backed by the US government Because our investment portfolio is diversified, we are not overly exposed to losses in any one geographical area, thus you might say that we have indirectly taken climate change into consideration  If adverse events occurred as a result of climate change, our lack of concentration would likely ensure that we would not be adversely impacted in a material manner The primary focus of our investment management has been in securities that are rated strongly as a result of their credit worthiness  In making investments in debt securities, we seek to avoid situations where there could be some correlation between risks related to our insured portfolio and our investment portfolio This is done by assessing the overall risk profile of the Company, without direct consideration given to climate risk",4

Anthem Health Plans Inc.,"   We consider there to be three types of risk related to climate change for the company  

1	 Extreme weather situations enhance concerns of ensuring business operations continue and employees are kept safe at all times

2	 Risks associated with changes in regulations could result in increased energy costs which would have a minimal impact on Anthems financial performance

3	We are concerned with the impact that climate change may have on the environmental health of communities and, ultimately, the impact this may have on the health of the members we serve  Climate change may lead to sicker populations, an increase in the prevalence and spread of infectious diseases and increased cases of respiratory conditions

Homesite Insurance Company of Georgia,"  Several enterprise risks are impacted by climate risk  Some of these are catastrophe, business interruption, capital adequacy, liquidity, underwriting, and reinsurer availability  The risk identification discussions identify new and evolving risks that may be components of the risk categories listed or new risks  ERM division personnel participate in several networking and professional organizations in order to ensure identification of risks on the horizon, within the insurance industry or across all industries  

As part of risk quantification, American Family uses an economic capital model to evaluate these risks and ensure that sufficient capital exists to meet our obligations to our policyholders in the event of unlikely, extreme (or tail) event scenarios such as an investment or natural catastrophe event  

ERM monitors extreme catastrophe model events that are beyond what the organization has experienced in its history to ensure it understands the impacts to capital, claim handling, reinsurance and other resources from extreme events  The division also performs catastrophe stress scenario testing that considers weather related catastrophes that are more extreme than experienced historically

American Family Connect Insurance Company," This includes providing customers with informational newsletters and brochures related to loss reduction For example, we provide brochures that outline how to reduce wildfire risk  We also offer discounts in many states for customers that have impact-resistant roof materials and a discount for customers who utilize connected home Loss control services are available for commercial and farm/ranch accounts Flood coverage is available through our agents via the National Flood Insurance Program 
Furthermore, American Family Insurance is a member of the Insurance Institute for Business and Home Safety (IBHS) The following text, prepared by IBHS, is a brief description of the Institute and some of its activities that relate to the issue of climate change
IBHS is a 501(c)(3) organization, wholly supported by the property (re)insurance industry, which conducts objective, scientific research to identify and promote effective actions that strengthen homes, businesses and communities against natural disasters and other causes of loss IBHS does this by identifying and advocating improved property design, construction, retrofitting, maintenance, repair and preparation practices IBHS guidance for mitigating property losses is available directly to the public and to our members/policyholders, at wwwdisastersafetyorg, and through social media (eg, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, YouTube and Vimeo)
IBHS advocates the concept of going green and building strong recognizing that addressing climate change involves reducing greenhouse gas emissions and adapting homes, businesses, and communities to severe weather that may result from climate change:
	As an insurance-supported organization, IBHS recognizes that climate change strategies must do more than build structures to be energy efficient They must be built to modern fire protection standards to help resist fire and avoid the water/chemical deluge needed for fire suppression; they should be strong enough to avoid wind destruction and resulting relocation in landfills; and properties should be sited and elevated in a manner that protects against flooding and environmental degradation from landslides All of these are part of going green
	IBHS also firmly believes that adaptation is critical, not only to reduce long-term property insurance losses, but to buttress individual and societal resilience All of the property protection measures that IBHS advocates to strengthen structures against current weather threats will also reduce future losses caused by climate change events And, the unprecedented scientific research conducted at the unique IBHS Research Center is critical to identification of new mitigation actions that may help protect against more severe weather events
	Additionally, research conducted by IBHS will help to make sure that green building enhancements do not inadvertently cause structures to be less disaster-resistant, or even worse, threaten the life safety of occupants or first respondersfor example, photovoltaic arrays that take flight or pose fire suppression challenges are the antithesis of building strong  

In 2014, American Family Insurance partnered with IBHS through a first-of-its-kind national study that will support IBHS researchers over the next 25 years in identifying the effects of aging on residential roofing materials, with the ultimate goal of making residential roofs last longer and leak less ultimately helping customers mitigate risks The study will determine how Midwest weather affects different brands of roofing material, using a dozen scientifically instrumented roof structures built on a bare patch of ground at American Family Insurances corporate headquarters This is a part of a larger study driven by IBHS and other participating member companies 

In 2015, American Family Insurance partnered with Nest Labs to offer Nest products to insured homeowners in an effort to reduce losses related to fire, water damage and exposure to carbon monoxide poisoning

Unum life Insurance Company of America," As a socially responsible corporation, Climate Change (CC) has been, and remains, deeply integrated into our core business and reflected in our environmental efforts and daily behaviors   

The developments of our CC strategy and reduction goals are examples of Unums adaptation to changing needs- in our business, with our customers, and in the environment  We are committed to a CC strategy that is part of a global solution  We are certain that our commitments and actions display our dedication and will result in continued business success

We have the following practices in place to ensure that our business mitigates, adapts, and advocates for CC and that it maintains integrated into our business strategy:
	Mitigation: ie insurance coverage for people affected by weather-related disabilities, disease, health and personal tragedies 
	Adaptation:  dedicated in-house research teams in place to asses and recommend products and services in response to environmental and market needs and changes The impact on health from emerging environmental changes and overall climate change are continually assessed as part of our business strategy Adaptation, enables us to identify business opportunities/priorities to ensure that we are financially sound and offering products and services that are needed and relevant to emerging needs  
	Advocacy: we are active in various committees, working groups, communities, and trade associations to educate and influence CC reductions

Our CC mitigation, including emission reduction targets, is reflected in our Strategic Energy Management Program (USEMP) Our enterprise-wide target by 2020 is to have reduced our energy by 30%, waste and water by 50% and CO2e emissions by 30% (base year 2008) This is being achieved through more efficient energy and water use, less business travel, use of green power, and investment in renewable energy Various smaller-scale projects to mitigate emissions are already in place, eg duplex printing to reduce paper, carpool programs, single-stream recycling, and many more 

The described approach is reflected in our short-term strategy, with recent findings being integrated into our business model and minor adjustments being made to our pricing and development of new products

Regarding our long-term CC strategy: Our Real Estate Management, Risk, and Product Development departments play an important role in trend analysis, long-term product development, and integration into our business strategy (ie internal adoption of renewable energy- in 2013 we began purchasing 5% of our total energy in RECs and plan to incrementally increase that each year)  

Unum has a long reputation for being a socially responsible company  By continually tracking, assessing, and reassessing our CC strategies and implementing increasingly aggressive carbon reduction efforts, we exemplify our dedication to our customers, investors, and the environment  We believe that our CC efforts and transparency improve our bankability and are attractive for investors and customers At the same time, we benefit from growing expertise on CC issues and the widening of our product portfolio, as well as from an improved risk management approach  Unums commitment to social and environmental responsibility and good reputation as a proactive and responsible player has positioned us advantageously among our competitors

Direct General Life Insurance Company," The incidence and severity of such events are inherently unpredictable, and our losses from catastrophes could be substantial Our 2018 financial results were significantly impacted by hurricanes and wildfires, and due to the inherent uncertainty of such catastrophes in future periods, any future impact remains difficult to predict 
Longer-term weather trends are changing and new types of catastrophe losses may be developing due to climate change, a phenomenon that may be associated with extreme weather events linked to rising temperatures, including effects on global weather patterns, sea, land and air temperature, sea levels, rain and snow Climate change could increase the frequency and severity of catastrophe losses we experience in both coastal and non-coastal areas
In addition, it is possible that we may experience an unusual frequency of smaller losses in a particular period In either case, the consequences could be substantial volatility in our financial condition or results of operations for any fiscal quarter or year, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations and our ability to write new business Although we believe that our geographic and product mix creates limited exposure to catastrophic events and we attempt to manage our exposure to these types of catastrophic and cumulative losses, including through the use of reinsurance, catastrophic events are inherently unpredictable and the severity or frequency of these types of losses may exceed our expectations as well as the limits of our reinsurance coverage

Continental Western Insurance Company," This may differ from the view of the catastrophe modeling vendor, and in some instances may cause us to take a more conservative view of certain types of risk
 This own view of catastrophe risk is used both at a macro level, for assessing our overall exposures, and at a micro level, for assessing an individual location
 The ERM and Catastrophe teams monitor the key catastrophe exposures for the overall Group and for each individual operating company Each company receives data on its exposures and has been provided with mapping software developed specifically for the monitoring and modeling of catastrophes This mapping software allows each company to identify its exposed limits by line of business and type of exposure (buildings, contents, business interruption), the number of locations, and the actual policies that are exposed in a particular area
 Each operating company includes within its business plan the catastrophe exposed limits they anticipate for the next year by region and county tier; the ERM and Catastrophe teams monitor each company against their planned aggregate over the course of each year
 The ERM team identifies to both senior management and to our operating companies those locations and policies which are most likely to give rise to a substantial loss from hurricane
 Both senior management and our operating companies are regularly provided with updates on the latest published articles and reports on climate change as part of our emerging issues weekly update report
 The Group restricts its investments in municipal bonds in areas that are most subject to catastrophic loss
 The ERM and Investment teams coordinate to monitor the Group exposure to municipal bonds in those states that are most likely to experience significant catastrophes
 When considering real estate purchases, the Investment team considers the exposure to catastrophe at that location When there is a risk of catastrophe, the ERM team works with the Investment team to assess that risk, and this assessment is taken into consideration when determining whether to proceed with the purchase

Investment Management perspective, the companies look at: 
In the normal course of researching and performing due diligence on investment opportunities, the investment department assesses many different risk factors including (but not limited to) inflation, demographic shifts, economic trends, management issues, interest rates, consumer behavior, competitive forces, credit risk, political risk, convexity risk, climate change, and others The investment department does not maintain specific policies for these risk factors but attempts to assess the impact that each of them will have on our ability to realize the desired rate of return that is modeled for each investment For each type of investment, the relevant risk factors mentioned above will be subjected to sensitivity analysis to determine their relative impact on the expected returns Therefore, if one of the most relevant risk factors for a given investment opportunity was identified as climate change (an energy investment for example), then various scenarios would be run at different cost structures and revenue levels to assess the impact on operating margins as a result of changing energy consumption patterns, competitive pressures from substitute products, regulatory decisions, penalties and fees, lawsuits, changes in law, etc

MAPFRE determines and assesses emissions caused by its activity according to the pertinent international standard, the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol
Direct emissions
It covers emissions generated in buildings, offices, garages and vehicles (Scope 1) MAPFRE applies maintenance and control programmes to not only ensure that installations capable of generating atmospheric emissions comply with the parameters established by the regulations, but also that performance is optimal and emissions minimal
Indirect emissions
Calculating the energy consumption emissions caused by activities carried out inside its establishments (Scope 2, according to the GHG Protocol) allows MAPFRE to assess the effect of both the individual and group energy saving programmes and initiatives described above
In terms of the carbon footprint emissions of goods and services required for its business activity (Scope 3), MAPFRE has calculated and estimated the trends of those associated with business trips and paper consumption
The programmes for reducing these emissions are focused on promoting conferences, video conferences and other telecommunications tools, and in the above-mentioned zero emissions paper consumption and paper acquisition reduction plans
The table below shows the changes in MAPFRE's carbon footprint

Sate Farm Florida Insurance Company,"
In responding, State Farm has utilized the definition of impact of climate change risk developed for the Financial Condition Examiners Handbook which is
the impact of climate change risk may be identified as any significant change in the measures of climate over an extended period of time that includes major changes in relative temperatures, precipitation, or wind patterns that occur over several decades or longer It may include the effects from the increase in severity and occurrence of climate change-related weather events (some may include but are not limited to: thunderstorms - including severe hail and strong winds; tornadoes; hurricanes; windstorms; the aftermath of floods; heat waves; droughts; rise in sea-level; forest fires; grass fires and the resultant subsequent debilitating effects created by these events)
Although State Farm does not specifically differentiate any increase or decrease in severity and occurrence of weather events to specific measures of climate, State Farm continuously measures and models risk for the perils insured under its contracts to determine its total risk exposure including those related to weather events Over the period from 1982 - 2016, non-hurricane catastrophe losses have been increasing by an average of 20%, with six of the largest ten non-hurricane catastrophe years occurring in the last ten  years after adjusting for policy growth and inflation  This trend is the result of several factors such as population concentration, population shift to the coastal regions, land use, as well as, changes to weather patterns related to climate change 

With respect to evaluating climate change risk, various units of the company(s) handle separate general functions, such as underwriting and actuarial, and the information developed is reported through the Enterprise Risk Management process   Within each function, there are several individuals and teams responsible for identifying and monitoring the potential risk and creating strategies to mitigate and manage such risk to financially sound levels  Each function team is evaluating and determining how best to approach the evaluation, for example, multiple models are used to underwrite certain exposures, including those based on historical data and others on changing weather patterns  In these efforts to evaluate and model weather related effects State Farm is continuously investing in the latest tools and improving techniques to model severe weather in order to accurately measure risk to better match risk to price of the various products  

No - The company does not have a climate change policy with respect to investment management
Risks associated with State Farms investments are continuously monitored and evaluated in order to preserve State Farms financial strength to ensure we can meet our obligations to our policyholders  While State Farm does not have a specific policy addressing climate change measures as they relate to potential risks to investments, investment analysis incorporates relevant risk factors into the decision making process, including impact on weather patterns and the innovation necessary to  produce reliable energy while lowering the carbon footprint  
The impact of climate change is managed through diversification guidelines across various asset types to prevent concentrations in a given geographic location, industry, property type, or municipal funding  Restrictions on investments in unregulated energy generation limit our exposure within the utilities industry  Coastal and earthquake exposures are managed in our commercial mortgage loan and real estate portfolios and are directly considered when evaluating investments in municipalities  In our real estate portfolio, we focus on the efficient operation of a building in an environmentally responsible manner and we evaluate new investments to determine whether it is economically and physically feasible to achieve a LEED certification  We also annually identify capital improvement projects and building system enhancements to reduce the use of energy  Additionally, we provide financing to entities that support green efforts as a subset of their business operations, such as municipal and state governments as well as utilities and energy companies  
The Investment Committee of the Board of Directors receives regular reports of investment diversification and exposures by various classifications, including geographic, industry, and property type

1)	Current & Emerging Regulation:  Risk of increased compliance cost with California AB 32 was evaluated in 2018 We have a significant presence in California and are therefore considering the implications of California AB 32 In particular, the 2020 reduction target for carbon intensity of transportation fuels used in California is relevant to us given that we operate our own fleet of vehicles We evaluate and monitor this risk from a business risk/impact perspective in conjunction with our multi-disciplinary company-wide risk identification, assessment, and management processes  We also considered risks from emerging state-level climate-related regulations in the United States from a compliance and business risk/impact perspective Twenty three US states  all of which we operate in  have adopted specific greenhouse gas emissions targets Emerging state-level regulations to support the achievement of these targets may have implications for our facilities and vehicle fleets in each state Climate-related risks from emerging regulations are evaluated in conjunction with our multi-disciplinary company-wide risk identification, assessment, and management processes
2)	Legal: Specific climate-related legal risks evaluated include looting, harm to employees, and shareholder concerns in the wake of climate-related extreme weather events These risks were evaluated and monitored from a business risk/impact perspective We mitigate these risks through our Enterprise Response and Resiliency (ERR) program, which encompasses our Business Continuity program There are legal risks associated with new compliance schemes which we are working to mitigate by ensuring compliance in advance and prior to those schemes taking effect An example would be the plastic bag ban in place in California which we addressed one (1) year ahead of the mandated time Climate-related legal risks are considered in conjunction with our multi-disciplinary company-wide risk identification, assessment, and management processes
3)	Market: Specific climate-related market risks evaluated include potential increases in electricity and fuel prices These risks were evaluated and monitored from a business risk/impact perspective We require a significant amount of electricity to operate our retail locations, offices, data centers, warehouses and distribution centers, as well as fuel for our vehicle fleet A sharp increase in prices could impact our profitability negatively  Transitioning to a low-carbon economy has inherent risks as well including being dependent on fossil fuels as this transition takes place  Inevitably, this will lead to increased costs for fossil fuel generation as economies of scale continue to drive the cost of renewable technologies down  We are mitigating that by ensuring that we reassess our energy procurement options to include a mix of renewables  By ensuring that we have a diverse fuel mix we can support the transition with greater ease, while still having the option to change the source of our energy supply  Ultimately, energy independence would be the ideal goal to ensure that operations are able to continue unhindered Climate-related market risks are evaluated in conjunction with our multi-disciplinary company-wide risk identification, assessment, and management processes

In 2010, Securian received the Sustainable St Paul Award in 2010 for protecting and restoring the environment in the city Our sustainable practices include: 

	Cleaning products and processes that comply with strict environmental and safety standards, sanitizing our buildings to protect health without affecting indoor air quality or harming the environment 
	A combination of smart and manual lighting controls for optimal energy effectiveness 
	Optimizing hardware configuration, monitoring electrical consumption and using energy efficient methods to heat and cool servers 
	Heating and cooling our downtown campus with a locally produced, renewable energy source 
	Extensive material recycling and reclamation programs, from paper and plastic to kitchen grease Office-grade paper is shredded by a secure recycler, pulped and reprocessed 
	Participating in equipment recycling programs to keep obsolete or toxic equipment out of landfills 

Securian also supports sustainable commuting by providing: 

	Bike racks and showers provided for associates and tenants who bike to work 
	Discounted bus passes for associates 
	Vanpool Commuter Check payroll deduction program 

Securian encourages its associates to: 

	Reduce paper waste by printing on both sides of the paper and using electronic forms or PDF files when sharing documents 
	Turn off supplemental lighting when away from desk and switch off the lights in conference rooms 


Finally, Securian purchases heating and cooling services from District Energy St Paul (DESP), the largest hot water district heating system in the United States, which leads the industry in technology integration targeted to improve the efficiency and environmental profile of the system and its users   Highlights of DESPs services are:

	In its 30 years of operation, DESPs heating system operates at twice the efficiency of the former steam district heating system while using the same amount of fuel  
	Carbon emissions for the overall system have been cut in half, while the system size has almost tripled  A major component of this efficiency is the incorporation of combined heat and power as the primary heat provider to the system  This has also allowed the incorporation of approximately 250,000 tons of biomass each year, sourced from local wood residues and forestry residuals  This has resulted in significant carbon reductions per unit of energy for each customer  
	The profile of the energy from the combined heat and power facility is 1984 tons/MWhr and DESPs 2014 goal is to reach 0185 tons/MWhr
	The integration of combined heat and power for the system allows two energy products (heat and electricity) to be generated from a single source, increasing fuel efficiency, reducing costs for end users, and reducing carbon profiles in both energy sectors  
	The combined heat and power plant has also reduced sulfur dioxide and particulate emissions, carbon dioxide emissions, and the use of oil, natural gas and coal 
	In 2010, DESP also integrated the nations largest solar hot water installation  The carbon footprint from the high-performance solar thermal installation resulted in carbon emission reductions of approximately 460,000 pounds in 2012  
	DESPs cooling system has also reduced the customers environmental profile  The integration of district cooling significantly reduced the use of chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) refrigerants in customer buildings and has reduced peak electricity usage through the incorporation of thermal storage
	DESPs system utilizes a fiber optic meter data collection system that is one of the most advanced in the industry  This system provides DESP with data to enable its acclaimed customer service team to help optimize building performance and provides customers with increased information to manage their building performance to meet or exceed efficiency standards

ACE American Ins Co," Risks are evaluated at least annually at three governance levels, with the companys senior management actively engaged in each The companys Risk and Underwriting Committee, product boards and risk-related committees meet as frequently as monthly to evaluate specific risks and risk accumulations in Chubbs business activities and investments, while the Board of Directors Risk and Finance Committee meets regularly with company management At the Board level, the Nominating & Governance Committee charter has been amended to incorporate provision for review of environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues, including climate change Various risk-related reports are provided at least quarterly to business division management, product boards and other risk-related committees, senior management, the Risk and Underwriting Committee, the Risk and Finance Committee, as well as the full Board

The companys risk management process identifies all known and emerging risks that could have a significant impact on Chubbs overall capital levels and financial results Our analysis of the impact of various risks ranges from the known, based on definitive historical loss experience, to the hypothetical, where we use a calculation called probable maximum loss (PML) that relies on modeling based on various assumptions Regarding the potential effects of catastrophe losses, we continue to closely monitor our catastrophe risk accumulation around the world In addition, we use catastrophe modeling packages reliant upon meteorology and engineering assumptions to simulate and estimate hurricane losses 

In its 10-K filed each year with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Chubb discloses risks that could have a material impact on the companys results of operations or financial condition, and identifies the occurrence of natural disasters as a key business risk The disclosure further notes that climate conditions may be changing, primarily through changes in global temperatures, which may increase the frequency and severity of natural catastrophes and the resulting losses in the future We cannot predict the impact that changing climate conditions, if any, may have on our results of operations or our financial condition Additionally, we cannot predict how legal, regulatory and/or social responses to concerns around global climate change may impact our business The occurrence of claims from catastrophic events could result in substantial volatility in our results of operations or financial condition for any fiscal quarter or year

Chubb has been a leading proponent and user of catastrophe models to quantify natural catastrophe risk for product pricing, risk management and capital allocation purposes Chubb uses these models to aggregate and monitor its natural catastrophe exposures across its portfolio and to ensure that its capital base is sufficiently strong to meet the expectations of regulators, rating agencies and policyholders and to provide shareholders with an appropriate risk-adjusted return Chubbs risk management modeling and underwriting practices continue to adapt to the developing risk exposures attributed to climate change For example, due to the fact that Earths climate appears to be changing in ways inconsistent with the historical record upon which catastrophe models draw data, Chubb has adopted a more short-term view of event frequency that proprietary catastrophe modeling tools address as part of their underwriting process, and we strictly regulate the concentration of those risks we are willing to underwrite 

Chubb also incorporates risk mitigation services through its risk management and site surveys; specification of terms and conditions in policies; and the development of sound underwriting guidelines into the underwriting of catastrophe-exposed products (eg, property, energy, marine or crop coverage) Chubbs modeling and underwriting approach allows for risk differentiation  and hence price differentiation  across our client base Clients that mitigate risk  through retrofitting buildings to comply with updated building codes, installation of hurricane shutters and relocating exposures away from coastlines and floodplains  will have lower insurance costs than those that do not Chubb also makes use of terms and conditions to ensure appropriate risk selection and potentially reward certain policyholder behavior 


The company is also actively engaged with regulators to ensure that pricing is actuarially sound and can be adapted to meet new and emerging climate change risks and the capital implications of these risks For Chubb to continue to offer coverage under climate change conditions, pricing must always be set at sound actuarial rates that cover loss costs, expenses and risk margins on exposed capital

Zurich is mindful of its environmental impact and in 2008 set itself a global target to reduce carbon emissions per employee by 10 percent by 2013 as compared to a 2007 baseline Zurich reached the original carbon reduction target ahead of schedule and has since extended its carbon reduction target with a goal to decrease carbon emissions per employee from its office buildings, and business travel by 50 percent by 2020 as compared to the 2007 baseline As of the end of 2014, Zurich has decreased carbon emissions per employee 37%  Additionally, Zurich has also reached its target to become carbon neutral as of the end of 2014 through its ambitious internal carbon reduction target and offsetting any remaining emissions through a forestry project in Indonesia, which is supporting Zurichs flood resilience program  Zurich aims to achieve their carbon emission reduction target  by reducing energy consumption, continuing to increase onsite generation and purchase of renewable energy and decreasing emissions from business travel by encouraging video- and teleconferencing and providing incentives to use public transportation  

In 2014, Zurich has switched its North America headquarters in Schaumburg, IL over to 100% green electricity (100% wind power) through electricity provider contracts, resulting in an increase in renewable power for its United States operations 53% as compared to the 2007 baseline

In addition to purchasing energy in an efficient, cost effective and environmentally responsible manner, Zurich has set the global target of reducing energy consumption per employee 40% by 2020 As of the end of 2014, Zurich has reduced energy consumption per employee by 30% Zurich aims to reach its global energy reduction target by implementing effective energy management programs such as replacing older technology lighting with retrofit products that easily fit into existing fixtures and making adjustments and observations by following the Facilities Management Carbon Footprint 30 Point Reduction Plan Some programs implemented at the Schaumburg, IL headquarters include reductions to HVAC and UPS loads in the server room, as data center equipment has migrated to our 3rd party supplier; and improved parking lot lighting control for one of the two towers, moving the loads to the building automation system 
Zurich continues to follow this trend by striving for LEED Platinum certification of their new North America headquarters currently being developed in Schaumburg, IL 

In addition to these improvements, Zurich has also implemented programs to remind employees to power down equipment when it is not in use  Many computer monitors and desktop computers are automatically set to go into a sleep or hibernation mode after a short period of inactivity

Zurich continues to work on reducing utilization of paper and office supplies  Copier/printer machines in many of our locations are set for duplex (two-sided) printing and the print/copy default has been set to black and white vs color  Zurich has completed the first year of a 3 year project to reduce the number of multifunctional devices (MDF) within their office buildings from 2,106 to 1,280 machines (39% reduction) and replace the remaining 61% with more energy efficient equipment, projecting an energy cost savings of $70,61200, 470,746 KWh and 324 tonnes of CO2 over a 3 year period In 2014, Zurich developed and implemented a Group-wide environmental management system (EMS), which builds on and integrates existing activities throughout the Group Beyond goals of reducing its global carbon footprint, the new system also addresses other areas of environmental impact in office buildings, mainly paper use, water consumption and waste generation  Zurichs EMS has been certified ISO 14001 for their Swiss operations See more about Zurichs Environmental Protection at the link below:

FMH AG RISK INSURANCE CO," The very nature of our business (crop insurance) is directly connected to not just climate change, but weather in general, geography, and geology The crop risks we insure are affected by these factors annually, thus a drought year, or an above average rainy summer are not unusual Obviously, if there were to be a number of years consecutively where there were above average moisture levels, this would have an effect on our business We do not view this as climate change however, and instead simply believe it to be the nature of the business of insuring agriculture

Regarding climate change and any investment decisions we make on behalf of the companys mutual policyholders, any such decision is made based on sound business judgment after diligent research and review The choice to invest is based upon the good faith belief that doing so is the best thing for the company and its owners (the policyholders) We take this fiduciary obligation seriously and this is what motivates us Climate change may affect what is worth investing in, but the decision is always centered on what is best for the company and the policyholders",1

Kaiser Foundation Plan of Washington," In 2018, KP was the leading health care sponsor of the Global Climate Action Summit in San Francisco, and CEO Bernard J Tyson addressed the conference Mr Tyson shared this video to illustrate the health risks attributed to climate change, and how organizations are coming together to address this as a matter of population health:  https://youtube/yeih2v4P25A 
Furthermore, KP has: 1 joined RE100, a collaborative, global initiative uniting more than 100 influential businesses committed to 100 percent renewable electricity; 2 helped found the California Healthcare Climate Alliance, a collaborative of health care organizations, facilitated by the NGO Health Care Without Harm, to urge policymakers and climate action advocates to integrate health and healthcare considerations into the development and implementation of climate change policy; 3 joined the Ceres Business for Innovative Climate and Energy Policy coalition to promote responsible bi-partisan public policy; 4 signed onto the Ceres Connect the Drops campaign on water stewardship, a campaign that showcases the strong leadership of California companies and policymakers to advance water solutions that ensure sustainable management of the states stressed, and often unpredictable, water supplies
KPs web site details our efforts to be a leader in advocating health in all policies and all sectors, and in working to end health disparities We have been active in developing and promoting policies and projects that afford greater access to more active modes of transportation and that support local food production and sustainable sources of healthy food In 2010, KP helped to successfully defeat a proposed rollback of Californias strong climate change laws
KP has worked with Eli Lilly and Company (Lilly) and the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB) to develop a water risk analysis framework for the supply chain of commodities (specialty chemicals, packaging, etc) that Lilly purchases for two of its major diabetes products for the US market UCSB used the World Resources Institute Aqueduct tool to identify first-tier suppliers located in water-stressed areas and developed a system to evaluate commodities produced in areas of relatively high water risk The insight gained into water-related risk associated with suppliers can better inform future sourcing decisions by Lilly Lilly has used the information to assess if current supplier risk-management practices are adequate and to determine if additional data are needed to support sound risk-management decisions Lilly has also evaluated how they might apply a similar framework to other products
As described in our response to Question 3, KP has supported improved research and risk analysis on the impact of climate change

North American Company For Life and Health Insurance,  The company has taken measures to become more energy efficient in each of its locations and is using geo-thermal technology in the only building that we own  The company does not have any physical operations in the state of California,0
Continental Western Insurance Company," This information is communicated via loss control surveys, tips brochures, newsletters and disaster planning material, weather alert postings on Company websites, State Department of Insurance bulletins communicated directly to insureds or through producers, webinars and training opportunities One Company offers tips on green construction, energy efficiency, influences of weather and other related topics via their social media pages (namely Twitter and LinkedIn) These loss control services provide insureds with practical tools needed to handle potential climate hazards in the best way possible and to mitigate the size/severity of the loss 
An example of a company distributing training materials to policyholders in an ecofriendly and cost effective manner is with the use of loss prevention specialists who train insureds to present Safety Meetings to their employees as it relates to high wind, changing road conditions, and winter driving conditions Additional training is also offered to those same policyholders via on demand videos and the training extends to cover any driver training that might be requested by the policyholder Online training allows the company to operate in a paperless environment and eliminates the need for physical training materials Additionally, loss prevention specialists can implement the training from remote locations and avoid traveling long distances to do in-person training
As another example of services provided to policyholders, one company offers risk management services that include roof inspection during risk surveys to help determine the integrity of the roof covering, erosion/landslide risks and brush fire/forest fire precautions and the results of these types of inspection information is communicated to the customer to help anticipate and reduce risks through increased knowledge By doing so, the policyholder has the information needed that would allow him/her to act proactively and prevent the likelihood of a loss A related measure is a second company who offers aircraft hurricane relocation reimbursement expense coverage to named insureds that reimburse a portion of eligible expenses incurred for relocating the aircraft to a safer location when a threat of a hurricane arises A third company encourages their insureds to store certain scheduled property, such as artwork, off the ground and allow for it to be moved quickly in the event of a storm Finally, a fourth office initiates risk management discussions after claims investigations or inspections to review any deficiencies in owned property and assist insureds in mitigating reoccurring exposure to losses 
An additional incentive used by one company in the group is the promotion of policyholder loss mitigation by offering green coverage endorsements for property, inland marine and equipment breakdown to policyholders to encourage them to convert to green products and materials Some Companies are in the process of adopting rating organizations green building endorsements with all of their property filings These endorsements support the green initiative and promote the use of environmentally friendly products that may reduce factors contributing to potential climate change related events 
One company providing coverages to publicly traded or large privately held companies, works closely with these insured entities who are by nature, complex, sophisticated operations already heavily focused on risk management, including climate change initiatives and are subject to SEC regulations requiring mandatory reporting and disclosure requirement with respect to Climate change issues to assist in managing these exposures Additionally there are protocols that have emerged for voluntary reporting of environmental matters established by nongovernmental entities including disclosure of information regarding environmental, sustainability, corporate social responsibility and more recently climate change and greenhouse gas emissions 
The pressure to comply with these voluntary disclosures arise from initiatives to create awareness among the public and institutional investors to compel companies to disclose environmental risk and impacts, and as a result to change their behavior to avoid future negative disclosure For these insured entities, disclosure takes on a broader process than simply complying with SEC requirements 
Because of the interrelationships of the stakeholders in the financial and economic marketplace, environmental disclosure is linked with environmental risk management Disclosure decisions are linked to the management of the risks that require disclosure Sustainability and social responsibility are key issues for large, sophisticated risks, and climate change is an important focus of socially responsible investors

(Hereinafter referred to as the Companies)

Please note that the above list of companies have approximately 20% of their total writings in Property and the remaining 80% of their total writings are for lines other than property; thus the primary business focus is on liability lines of insurance   

Berkley Life and Health Insurance Company (Berkley Life) writes health insurance and reinsurance in four primary areas: medical stop loss, managed care, special risk and group captive  Historically we have not experienced any increase in losses as a result of natural catastrophes such as hurricane, flood or tornado, nor do we currently anticipate this to occur in the future  Neither the management of Berkley Life nor the Berkley Group Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) team has identified any link between loss frequency and / or severity in these niche health insurance products written by Berkley Life and natural catastrophes such as hurricane, tornado, flood, drought or wildfire  Consequently although Berkley Life has full access to the Berkley Groups research into the potential impact of climate change, it is not currently an issue for Berkley Life from an insured loss perspective 

Yes, the Companies do the following:  
	Recycling: Our Companies participate in programs that encourage the recycling of paper, bottles, styrofoam and cans, as well as cardboards and plastics, as well as ink cartridges Document destruction bins and a pick-up service are used by nearly all offices within the Group that allow for proper destruction of paper files This service picks up, shreds, and recycles the paper in those destruction bins so that trees are preserved within the environment 
Additionally, some offices have drop off bins for employees wishing to donate things such as eyeglasses, batteries, and old cell phones Those companies then donate those items to organizations that are able to re-use the recycled items Office supplies are recycled by one company and then donated to an organization that provides low cost/free supplies to teachers who have a need for classroom items Several office locations recycle used computer equipment when possible and/or refurbish and donate equipment in working condition to local charitable organizations that are in need of computer equipment 
The Companies continually strive to promote a greener environment by converting to paperless as much as possible and imaging paper files into electronic documents  More frequently, offices are beginning to remind email recipients under the signature line of their email to consider the environment before printing to conserve paper  One office has placed codes on internal printers to monitor and discourage unnecessary printing and ensure that when printing is required, its being done in the most efficient format and to the most efficient printer for a given print job  
Email and phone communication, both with internal and external customers (namely policyholders) is encouraged to reduce the Companies carbon footprint and cut down on printed hard copy communications  One example of this conservation of paper to protect the environment is the setting up of claims electronically via telephone or email Another office is converting the delivery of marketing materials to electronic format rather than in paper format In most offices, whiteboards and digital projectors are installed in meeting rooms so that the amount of paper consumed is reduced when meetings are held 
One example of the Companies demonstrating their care for the environment occurred when their office building was under construction Instead of purchasing brand new fixtures and furnishings, they reused some materials such as doors, window treatments, light fixtures and ceiling grid from the previous building to save on cost and to reduce the amount of waste that they were putting in the landfill As far as cleaning materials for our offices buildings are concerned, the selection of cleaning materials within some of the locations is carefully considered and a large portion of the cleaning products used in certain offices are either environmentally safe cleaning products and/or are white vinegar based 

Office/Building Footprint:  Redesign of office space utilizing smaller more collaborative areas for the same number of people resulting in a reduction of overall lease space/footprint  

	Water & Conservation: Companies, as well as building managers for buildings occupied by Companies, closely monitor outdoor irrigation, some to an extent that sensors determine whether or not the grounds actually need water based on the amount of rainfall that the area has seen Others are set on timers and only run during specific, set times to provide for a more predictable monthly water bill In addition, the setting of timers to determine watering schedule allows for the building grounds to be watered with optimum efficiency, thereby reducing over-watering Internally, certain buildings have a filtration or reverse osmosis systems installed that provides filtered water to employees and is intended to promote the use of thermos/hard plastic water bottles and cut down on the amount of trash/recycling One of the Companies has low consumption water closets installed in all of the bathrooms to further reduce the amount of water used

	Lighting: Some Company buildings are currently in process of or already are Energy Star Rated Some have converted incandescent lighting to fluorescent and/or LED, low energy lighting Lighting of buildings at most office locations is set for regularly scheduled business hours and is of limited use on nights and weekends  In addition, employees are encouraged to turn lights off in areas not in use and reminders are placed in those areas to encourage employees to conserve energy when possible In some offices, motion activated sensors have been installed for lighting so that energy is automatically conserved when an area is not being used  Externally, parking garage lighting is also set on a timer schedule and only provides lighting during scheduled hours of the day, rather than continuously

	Heating and Cooling: Companies monitor usage of heating and cooling systems and many set heat pumps back at night and during non-business hours to conserve energy usage when employees are not there When reviewing energy usage, consideration of replacement units with 80% efficiency to units that are 98% higher in efficiency ratings, are regularly reviewed  When employees are in the building, heat and cooling system temperatures are closely monitored using a computerized environment with limited access, and systems run only when necessary rather than continuously On nights and weekends, heating and cooling can be limited to areas where an employee is based and is on a timer scheduled system Having areas on a timer system eliminates the need to heat or cool an entire building for an individual during non-standard business hours 
Regular, scheduled preventative maintenance is done on heating and cooling systems to ensure optimum efficiency and cut down on any possible wasted energy (this includes regular changing of air filters, etc)  Additionally, one of the Companies has 2 HVAC chiller systems that are environmentally friendly and operate during the summer months to cut down on humidity within the building and aid in keeping the energy exertion of the air conditioning to a lower level  Some offices either have or are in the process of replacing older heat pumps with newer, more energy efficient units to further reduce energy consumption   

	Technology: Company intranet pages and emails are encouraged as a main source of communication Additionally Companies have developed or are in the process of developing electronic portals which allow the agent and/or policy holder to download or save their policies electronically from the portal, thus reducing use of paper, printer ink and mailing costs  Tablets are available to some employees at a few of the offices that help to minimize the need to print reports and materials for meetings with internal and external customers Additionally, the use of social media sites (Twitter and LinkedIn) provides an opportunity to communicate information electronically without the need for printing hard copies IT, at one location, is in process of enhancing their technology by converting computer monitors from LCD to LED and replacing older computer systems with more up to date, energy efficient models In addition, at one location there has been a conversion of the server room to a more energy efficient area that promotes less usage of cooling systems   Other companies within the Group share an office location and a data center that allows for them to consolidate the amount of energy and resources used 

Increasingly offices are installing power shut offs on all desk computer systems to further save on energy during non-standard business hours and weekends Some employees have the capability to access the office remotely to curtail transportation to and from the office Video/web conferencing is also becoming more common amongst offices to reduce the frequency of travel, but still allow individuals to meet on work-related topics as required 

	Transportation: Carpooling has been adopted by a number of the offices as a means to cut down on the number of cars on the road and reduce emissions released by vehicles  To promote use of public transit to get to and from work, one office offers an employer sponsored public transit pass system to encourage continued use of public transportation A particular office has a designated bicycle storage facility within their office building to promote the use of greener means of transportation to and from work, whether that be biking to work or using public transportation and then biking to the office

An example of a company incentivizing employees to reduce their carbon footprint is through a Trip Reduction Program that rewards employees who carpool the majority of each work week Those employees, in turn, get placed into a drawing for a monthly prize amongst the members that participate in the program

Telecommuting and hiring remote workers is increasingly for some departments and offices  When hiring, some companies are now giving much greater credence to hiring new employees to work remotely including hiring out of state  This enables companies to expand their workforce nationwide and allows employees to remain in their state of residence in order to stay close to family or in a location of their choosing  The ability to work from home allows individuals to remote in and work from their home, to save fuel costs, reduce the number of cars on the road and also cut down on the emissions released into the air by vehicles  As another means of reducing emissions and fuel costs, a few of the office locations have company cars that are either hybrid and/or get 30+ mpg  A second method of cutting down on daily commutes is achieved by offices positioning themselves or relocating to areas where most staff can easily use public transport to get to work, rather than driving personal vehicles 
Other Companies within the Berkley organization are also beginning to open up satellite office(s) that allow Berkley employees located in nearby vicinities to share an office space and also cut down travel time significantly for employees who may live closer to the satellite office than to the home office of the company for which they are employed An alternative thats offered by some companies is allowing employees to work flexible hours so that employees may avoid commuting during high traffic times to and from work

Great West Life Insurance and Annuity Co,"
Great-West continually evaluates the risks that could impact its business operations or customers and applicable governance pertaining to climate change risk The company also devotes significant resources to the development of its risk management and disaster recovery policies and procedures Great-West recognizes, however, that despite its planning, business operations may be exposed to unidentified or unanticipated events or risks beyond its control These risks include weather related events, pandemics, or other natural and man-made catastrophes The inherent uncertainties of estimating the risks and liabilities are greater in such situations than in quantifiable scenarios Great-West periodically tests its disaster recovery procedures to assess effectiveness and preparedness It is worth noting that Great-West was able to seamlessly transition to a 100% work from home model at the onset of COVID-19 with no impact material impact on operations
In an effort to monitor and address these on-going risks, Great-West maintains a Risk Management division, headed by the Chief Risk Officer, which develops comprehensive risk management programs and policies to manage the risks associated with both natural and man-made disasters",1

Enumclaw Property & Casualty Insurance Co.," This ranges from severe winter storms to flooding to wildfire risk caused by drought Mutual of Enumclaw manages these risks through underwriting activities to ensure the Company is not over-exposed for any one risk and through reinsurance partners as described earlier Other risks posed by climate change are regulatory in nature If regulatory agencies do not allow the insurance mechanism work naturally and introduce mandates for coverage, then consumers will suffer as insurers lose the ability to manage their risk portfolios The basic tenet of insurability of risk is that it must be measurable and random in nature It is also important that companies have the ability to determine what risks they will insure so as to manage their overall risk and mix of business effectively and prudently Other risks of climate change include potential litigation concerning climate based change and potential lawsuits alleging that businesses are responsible for causing the climate change This could result in additional loss costs not anticipated when drafting the coverage grants in the policies",3
Regence Blue Cross Blue Shield of Oregon," However, there is a heightened awareness within the ERM function on climate change and health risks With the ever changing landscape of health care risks, the ERM function constantly updates Cambias risk universe and its risk categories for better identification, classification, and management of enterprise wide risks Climate risks are currently classified under the Corporate Responsibility and Sustainability category within our risk universe However, at this point in time, we have not identified any climate risks that would impede achievement of our strategic objective

The risks of climate change on Cambias health insurance operations relate primarily to any resulting increases in average morbidity rates Changes in morbidity risks are monitored through existing risk management practices and measured against pricing assumptions Cambia monitors risks and impairments to its investment portfolio on an ongoing basis  With respect to asset management we do not have a direct or exclusive risk assessment related to climate change We do regularly review both our liquidity, capital, and income needs of our investment portfolio as a part of a regular investment risk assessment and risk tolerance setting process, which considers a variety of potential risks and impacts It is, in fact, the unknown future costs, impacts, and needs which along with the effect of climate change risk, whether related to underwriting or other factors, represent another reason to maintain strong surplus levels to ensure ability to continue meeting the needs of our members

Physicians Life Insurance Company," In conjunction with our Green Team committee, the Company has implemented, and continues to evaluate, multiple recycling and energy saving programs at our Home Office locations Employees are also encouraged to recycle, reduce fuel consumption and conserve energy at home  Physicians Mutual also sponsors and participates in community programs that promote green environment programs and initiatives both locally and in cities across the country in which our division offices are located",0
Homesite Insurance Company of New York,"  The catastrophe management area works closely with underwriting to manage our exposure to catastrophic events and with pricing areas to rate for risk associated with weather and climate change events  

First, this involves staying abreast of scientific and industry research on climate change and its expected impact on homeowners insurance costs in order to consider these for pricing and exposure management    Homesite monitors trends in severe weather including observed trends in precipitation  It is well documented that instances of extreme precipitation in recent years is higher than in prior years, particularly for the Midwest and Northeast  There is general agreement in the scientific community that warmer global temperatures are facilitating these type of extreme events  In particular, an officer of the company is a member of the Insurance Institute for Business and Home Safety (IBHS) Residential Committee  IBHS conducts research into losses caused by natural perils in order to advocate improved construction, maintenance, weather event preparation, and safety measures  Also, Homesite maintain contacts with academics in the Boston area involved in meteorological programs to keep up with recent advances in science related to climate change

Second, this involves the use of catastrophe models to model and estimate the effects of hurricane, tornado, hail, and other weather events  Estimates of probable maximum loss are generated for the full enterprise and at more granular geographic areas such as zip code to guide our acceptance of weather and climate related risk  Given that there is considerable uncertainty regarding the output of these models, Homesite factors this into our decision making regarding the writing of policies exposed to natural perils

Lastly, for non-modeled perils Homesite licenses and integrates into the underwriting processes additional vendor tools to further educate adequate risk assessment, selection, pricing and inspection activities These practices are of particular interest for the peril of wildfire  A significant portion of the continental United States has seen drought conditions persist over the past several years increasing the frequency and severity of wildfire activity 

Also, American Family evaluates climate risk impacts on all risk enterprise risks  Several enterprise risks are impacted by climate risk  Some of these are catastrophe, business interruption, capital adequacy, liquidity, underwriting, and reinsurer availability  The risk identification discussions identify emerging and evolving risks that may be components of the risk categories listed or new risks  ERM division personnel participate in several networking and professional organizations in order to ensure identification of risks on the horizon, within the insurance industry or across all industries  In 2013 it participated in several webinars, emerging risk surveys and meetings where climate risk was discussed

As part of risk quantification, American Family uses an economic capital model to evaluate these risks and ensure that sufficient capital exists to meet our obligations to our policyholders in the event of unlikely, extreme (or tail) event scenarios such as an investment or natural catastrophe event 
 
ERM monitors extreme catastrophe model events that are beyond what the organization has experienced in its history to ensure it understands the impacts to capital, claim handling, reinsurance and other resources from extreme events  The division also performs catastrophe stress scenario testing that considers weather related catastrophes that are more extreme than experienced historically",2
"Trexis Insurance Corporation - A wholly owned subsidary of Alfa Corporation, a general business holding company","  We use hurricane and severe storm models to quantify this weather risk and address it through pricing, underwriting, and reinsurance decisions

American Continental Insurance Company," As a US-based insurance benefits corporation, Aetna does not produce products or services that lead directly to the emissions of substantial amounts of greenhouse gases or other pollutants Impact Aetna considers the impact to be additional costs associated with regulatory compliance Timeframe Aetna is uncertain when additional regulatory requirements would be required; however, best guess would be sometime within 6-10 years additional requirements would start to phase in  Direct/Indirect Aetna considers itself indirectly exposed to regulatory risks related to greenhouse gas emissions Likelihood of impact Aetna assumes the likelihood of increased regulatory requirements occurring as about as likely as not (between 33% and 66% probability) Magnitude of impact Given the impact of previous environmental regulations, Aetna believes the magnitude of the impact to the company to be low	Increased operational cost	Un-known	Indirect (Supply chain)	More likely than not	Low









The following are the (i) the potential financial implications of the risk before taking action; (ii) the methods you are using to manage this risk and (iii) the costs associated with these actions:

i) the potential financial implications of the risk before taking action:
As a US-based insurance benefits corporation, Aetna does not produce products or services that lead directly to the emissions of substantial amounts of greenhouse gases or other pollutants Thus, any regulations addressing climate change will not directly impact our products and services Rather, changes in environmental laws and regulations, whether inside and/or outside the US, are likely to impact Aetna's cost of doing business indirectly in the form of higher utility costs Aetna leases the vast majority of its office locations and expects that any changes in governmental policy concerning climate change will likely impact power generation (ie, utility) companies, which can be expected to pass on those costs to commercial landlords and other property owners which, in turn, can be expected to pass on those costs to commercial tenants, such as Aetna, over time
The scarcity of wood and wood pulp products may impact Aetna in any new construction project it might in the future undertake and would also impact the cost of office supply products, such as printer paper Other raw materials may also become scarcer or more expensive in the future due to the energy cost associated with their manufacture (eg, plastic) Those in our value chain will be similarly impacted through higher energy costs associated with their operations Aetna's vendors and suppliers will face higher overhead costs in the form of energy use and, where relevant, the cost of manufacture of certain items, and will be forced to pass those costs on to Aetna and other customers  Aetna will be indirectly impacted by increased costs for our suppliers and vendors Aetna's vendors and suppliers will face higher overhead costs in the form of energy use and, where relevant, the cost of manufacture of certain items, and will be forced to pass those costs on to Aetna and other customers Aetna will be indirectly impacted by increased costs for our suppliers and vendors
(ii) The methods we are using to manage this risk:  
At our corporate headquarters in Connecticut and in a few additional locations, Aetna possesses a modest amount of fuel burning equipment in order to handle power generation and business continuity needs in an emergency power outage situation We purchase low sulfur fuel for this equipment and would expect that any laws or regulations regarding the use of, and emissions from, this fuel burning equipment would impact Aetna directly However, based on past experience we would expect the activation and use of this fuel burning equipment to be an infrequent occurrence To help manage risks associated with a potential scarcity of office materials, Aetna has in place comprehensive recycling programs We use environmentally friendly paper for the printing of marketing materials, an effort that in 2012 helped save 302 tons of paper, and we recycle paper, carcboard, glass and plastic bottles Aetna has recycled fluorescent light bulbs since 1994, long before it was required

(iii) the costs associated with these actions:
Aetna has been unable to forecast the impact increased climate change regulation would have on our cost vs that from normal supplier variation (again, indirect costs) As discussed elsewhere (see Section 11, Energy elsewhere in this response) Aetnas energy costs, which are a direct cost, are integrated into annual budgets Any increase in fuel costs would need to be accounted for by the affected using department(s)

The following are descriptions of (i) the potential financial implications of the risk before taking action; (ii) the methods you are using to manage this risk; and (iii) the costs associated with these actions:

i) The potential financial implications of the risk before taking action:
As a US-based insurance benefits corporation, with an owned corporate headquarters in Connecticut and leased space throughout the US and internationally, we consider our company to be exposed to physical risks As a geographically diverse organization with workers located throughout the US and several overseas locations, Aetna is exposed to the physical risks of climate change The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (""IPCC"") describes an accelerating transition to a warmer globe marked by more extreme temperatures and extreme weather events (eg, increases in the frequency and severity of cyclone and hurricane activity) Specifically, in light of these predictions, Aetna's offices in Florida and along the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic seaboard potentially may be impacted by increased hurricane activity Aetna maintains these and other offices in support of our customers and to maintain a local market presence
(ii) The methods we are using to manage this risk:
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (""IPCC"") describes an accelerating transition to a warmer globe marked by more extreme temperatures and extreme weather events (eg, increases in the frequency and severity of cyclone and hurricane activity) While some of the IPCC's scientific work has been called into question by some, there is evidence to suggest at least more variability in the world's weather - a phenomenon that has been called ""global weirding""  In light of all of these predictions, Aetna's offices in Florida and along the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic seaboard potentially may be impacted by increased hurricane activity Aetna maintains these and other offices in support of our customers and to maintain a local market presence Aetna already has plans in place to respond to emergencies and other potential physical risks Our emergency and business continuity plans exist to ensure that Aetna is able to serve its customers without interruption regardless of natural or other disaster Aetna continues to evaluate its office location decisions based on the needs and location of our customers, the cost of doing business at a given site and other variables including the possibility of an extreme weather event which may impact our operations in that location  Aetna, as well as many of its vendors, customers and suppliers in Aetna's value chain are located in geographically diverse locations that might be impacted by these risks  We consider our company as well as those in our value chain to be exposed to physical risks
Aetna already has plans in place to respond to emergencies and other potential physical risks Our emergency and business continuity plans exist to ensure that Aetna is able to serve its customers without interruption regardless of natural or other disaster
(iii) the costs associated with these actions:
Aetna continues to evaluate its office location decisions based on the needs and location of our customers, the cost of doing business at a given site and other variables including the possibility of an extreme weather event which may impact our operations in that location If Aetna and others in its value chain experience these kinds of events, then the cost of doing business is likely to increase for all Aetna has been unable to determine if these costs would increase substantially over what is currently spent
We do not expect our company to be exposed to risks driven by changes in other climate-related developments that have the potential to generate a substantive change to our business operations, revenue or expenditure for the following reasons:

Aetna has been unable to determine what other climate change related risks it would be exposed to, especially those generating a substantive change to business operations Aetna constantly monitors impact drivers to its business and has determined that those directly impacting its health care business need the most attention at the current time
Aetna has been monitoring climate change legislation and regulation over the past decades and has not been able to determine if political leadership has any better idea of what will happen than Aetna does It appears that any legislation that will occur, notwithstanding political posturing, will be slow in materializing If so, this allows Aetna time to adapt its existing business processes to account for any changes at that time

Associated Industries of MA Mutual Insurance Co,  We do not insure property risks,7
COMBINED LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY OF NEW YORK," Specifically, Chubb will pay up to a certain amount to repair or replace damaged property if it is a ""green alternative"" This includes: energy efficient appliances, electronics, heating and cooling systems, home envelope materials, interior plumbing systems and lighting fixtures, low Volatile Organic Compound (VOC) paints, primers, solvents, finishes, adhesives, low emissions carpet and floor coverings, and Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) - certified wood There are also premium credits available to customers who demonstrate that they have taken preventative measures

Further, as one of the largest crop insurance providers in the US, the company engaged directly and through trade associations with legislators on approaches for improving the public-private crop insurance program for farmers within the proposed broad farm legislation Chubb supports solutions that maintain and improve upon the coverage against climate-related risks such as the severe widespread drought conditions that devastated several important crops during the 2012 and 2013 growing seasons as well as hurricanes and wildfires in the 2017 and 2018 growing seasons in the US  We support the offering of these coverages to farmers through the crop insurance program because they are a viable risk management tool for individual farmers and continue to support the broad US farming economy We also support the expansion of products that encourage the use of conservation practices and sustainable agriculture as part of farm level risk management

Also, in addition to direct US legislative advocacy on Capitol Hill, Chubb is a member of the SmarterSafer Coalition which  is a national coalition that is made up of diverse entities united in favor of environmentally -responsible, fiscally-sound approaches to natural catastrophe policy that promote public safety Chubb and SmarterSafer Coalition members support reform of the National Flood Insurance  Program (NFIP) and jointly believe that Congress should continue to move NFIP to fiscal soundness by gradually phasing properties to risk-based rates, coupled with mitigation assistance and affordability measures for low-income property owners In addition, the Federal Emergency Management Agency should continue to have the opportunity to purchase reinsurance to manage and reduce risk In addition, Chubb supports recent efforts to clarify the fact that homeowners can satisfy mandatory purchase requirements for lenders with private flood insurance policies

At the state level, Chubb supports incentivizing localities and individuals to undertake mitigation efforts and to take steps to enhance resilience after a natural disaster Chubb seeks to minimize the public tax burden, to the greatest extent possible, by maximizing private market opportunities

Victoria Specialty Insurance Company,"  A robust Enterprise Risk Management program identifies potential risks and develops controls to systematically assess the impact of these risks to its business  
As part of the detailed risk assessment, Nationwides Enterprise Risk Management team works in collaboration with the business leaders across the multiple businesses to understand the risk that climate change poses over the strategic horizon  This process involves identifying exposure for incremental risk and reward as well as assessing the companys capabilities against industry practices  Risks associated with climate change as identified through Nationwides risk assessment process are discussed in the response to question four above
In order to measure the risks from certain natural perils potentially associated with climate change, Nationwide licenses the software and support of external catastrophe modeling vendors  These vendors constantly review and update their models to incorporate the most recent science available 
These models allow Nationwide to measure their catastrophe exposure and develop a perspective on the potential size and likelihood of various catastrophes  These models also allow the Nationwide companies to assess how various strategies will impact this risk including changes to deductibles, changes to market shares and geographic diversification
Specific to the hurricane peril, the major catastrophe modeling vendors have developed alternative event scenario catalogs associated with increased sea surface temperatures which some scientists might attribute to global warming  Elevated sea surface temperatures are important because hurricanes are fueled by the warmth of the ocean  These alternative event catalogs, therefore, represent a climate-conditioned view of risk  This alternate view is used to assess the sensitivity of insured risk to elevated sea surface temperatures  
Beyond the direct output from the models, measurement and sensitivity analysis can be informed by maintaining external partnerships in academia, trade associations, experts from the modeling vendors, and reinsurers and brokers  Nationwide has developed these types of external relationships and regularly avails itself of information from these sources as an integral part of the risk management program
Additional techniques utilized by Nationwide to manage catastrophe risks are discussed in the response to question six above

LM Insurance Corporation,"  The Company is a member of the Geneva Association, which has an ongoing global initiative to assess the potential impacts of climate change on the insurance industry and develop strategies to enable the industry to address these impacts  

Liberty Mutual is a member of the Insurance Institute for Business & Home Safety (IBHS)  The following text, prepared by IBHS, is a brief description of the Institute and some of its activities that relate to the issue of climate change

IBHS is a 501(c)(3) organization, wholly supported by the property (re)insurance industry, which conducts objective, scientific research to identify and promote effective actions that strengthen homes, businesses, and communities against natural disasters and other causes of loss IBHS does this by identifying and advocating improved property design, construction, retrofitting, maintenance, repair, and preparation practices  IBHS guidance for mitigating property losses is available directly to the public and to our members/policyholders, at wwwdisastersafetyorg, and through social media (eg, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, YouTube and Vimeo)

IBHS advocates the concept of going green and building strong recognizing that addressing climate change involves both reducing greenhouse gas emissions and adapting homes, businesses, and communities to severe weather that may result from climate change:

¿	As an insurance-supported organization, IBHS recognizes that climate change strategies must do more than build structures to be energy efficient  They must be built to modern fire protection standards to help resist fire and avoid the water/chemical deluge needed for fire suppression; they should be strong enough to avoid wind destruction and resulting relocation in landfills; and properties should be sited and elevated in a manner that protects against flooding and environmental degradation from landslides  All of these are part of going green
¿	IBHS also firmly believes that adaptation is critical, not only to reduce long-term property insurance losses, but to buttress individual and societal resilience  All of the property protection measures that IBHS advocates to strengthen structures against current weather threats will also reduce future losses caused by climate change events  And, the unprecedented scientific research conducted at the unique IBHS Research Center is critical to identification of new mitigation actions that may help protect against more severe weather events
¿	Additionally, research conducted by IBHS will help to make sure that green building enhancements do not inadvertently cause structures to be less disaster-resistant, or even worse, threaten the life safety of occupants or first respondersfor example, photovoltaic arrays that take flight or pose fire suppression challenges are the antithesis of building strong  

Engagement of policyholders is provided in several ways  The Company offers discounts to policyholders that have taken specific steps to reduce their susceptibility to extreme weather events through structural modifications to their properties  Policyholders are incentivized to reduce their CO2 emissions through products that cover structural modifications such as installed solar panels with full replacement guarantees, and discounts for hybrid vehicles  Other products and endorsements allow for replacement of existing mechanical equipment and appliances with upgraded high efficiency units in the event of a loss  The Company also has Loss Prevention units staffed by engineers and other technical experts who consult directly with commercial property owners and develop detailed plans for actions that can be taken to reduce the susceptibility of losses due to severe weather events

Allstate Insurance Group," Allstate completes a comprehensive inventory of all Scope 1, 2, and select Scope 3 emissions annually and reports the verified findings through CDP

Allstate has established an absolute emissions reduction goal aimed at reducing energy use at owned facilities to 20% below 2007 levels by 2020 and is continuously working to identify and act on other non-energy related emissions reduction opportunities As of December 2012, Allstate has reduced Scope 1, 2, and select Scope 3 emissions by approximately 22% compared to a 2007 baseline

A sampling of projects implemented to date include installation of more efficient light fixtures, reductions in the hours lights are used, operation of sophisticated lighting controls which include daylight harvesting features and occupancy sensors, paperless solutions (eBill, ePayments, and ePolicy), real estate consolidation, improvement in fuel economy of the corporate fleet, and building material recycling In total, Allstate estimates these activities resulted in nearly 21,000 MT of CO2 emissions reductions
in 2012 (Scope 1, 2, & 3)

Projects planned for 2013 and beyond include electric vehicle charging stations at corporate office campus in Northbrook, IL To reduce the energy associated with data storage and other computing-intensive processes, Allstate has begun increasing the temperature at owned data centers, thereby reducing the overall cooling load at these facilities

Sate Farm Florida Insurance Company,"  State Farm works with organizations across the country  such as the Institute for Building and Home Safety (IBHS), ProtectingAmericaorg, and the Federal Alliance for Safe Homes (FLASH)  to help protect our policyholders from the human injuries, property destruction and financial impact that can result from natural disasters and State Farm is a member of the Build Strong Coalition These efforts are focused on building codes, land use and general awareness of mitigation issues

The following text, prepared by IBHS, is a brief description of the Institute and some of its activities that relate to the issue of climate change
IBHS is a 501(c)(3) organization, wholly supported by the property (re)insurance industry, which conducts objective, scientific research to identify and promote effective actions that strengthen homes, businesses, and communities against natural disasters and other causes of loss IBHS does this by identifying and advocating improved property design, construction, retrofitting, maintenance, repair, and preparation practices  IBHS guidance for mitigating property losses is available directly to the public and to our members/policyholders, at wwwdisastersafetyorg, and through social media (eg, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, YouTube and Vimeo)
IBHS advocates the concept of going green and building strong recognizing that addressing climate change involves both reducing greenhouse gas emissions and adapting homes, businesses, and communities to severe weather that may result from climate change:
	As an insurance-supported organization, IBHS recognizes that climate change strategies must do more than build structures to be energy efficient  They must be built to modern fire protection standards to help resist fire and avoid the water/chemical deluge needed for fire suppression; they should be strong enough to avoid wind destruction and resulting relocation in landfills; and properties should be sited and elevated in a manner that protects against flooding and environmental degradation from landslides  All of these are part of going green

As a building science institute, and due to antitrust concerns, IBHS does not have access to, and cannot compile, a list of market-based discounts offered by specific insurers with respect to current or future weather scenarios  That said, IBHS research helps its member companies to better understand structural vulnerability and the role that mitigation plays in reducing damage from severe weather, as well as what mitigation features to look for when inspecting a residential or commercial building
A few states (Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina and South Carolina) have developed legislative or regulatory discount frameworks for homes built or retrofitted to the code-plus, hazard-specific FORTIFIED new construction and retrofit standards developed by IBHS  In these states, the Institute has worked with insurance regulators and insurance companies to make sure that the discount programs work as they were intended upon enactment, and actually facilitate risk-based pricing, which can serve both to encourage effective mitigation and discourage unsound development in disaster-prone areas 
The quickest way for individual property owners to find out if their residential or commercial building qualifies for an incentive (for example, by meeting the designation requirements of the FORTIFIED program) is to ask their insurance department or company  In addition to discounts, insurance incentives related to mitigation may include a positive decision by an underwriter to provide coverage in the voluntary, rather than through the residual market, lower deductibles, or more favorable coverage terms relating to post-disaster claims payments  Again, these are business decisions made by individual insurers, and IBHS neither influences such decisions nor specifically tracks them
State Farm has designed a website Energy Management-State Farm to provide policyholders with energy-related educational tools, resources and solutions  
As noted in earlier responses the Drive Safe and SaveTM promotes green initiatives, in part, by incentivizing fewer miles driven through lower premiums  Additionally there are many efforts underway in many business areas to streamline the customer communication experience and provide our customers with preferred communication channels  using electronic/paperless delivery options, and/or integrated mailings for all written communications related to sales and services, including billing and payment options
Finally, a multi-disciplined committee has been formed to evaluate corporate citizenship and consumer education and protection

Indemnity Ins Co of North America," However, through our Corporate Environmental Program, we are committed to measuring, recording and reducing our mark on the environment even further This global effort focuses on reducing the direct and indirect GHG emissions generated from heating, cooling and lighting our offices and from company owned or leased vehicles, as well as the reduction, reuse or recycling of resources In 2007, prior to ACEs January 2016 acquisition of The Chubb Corporation and adoption of the Chubb name, ACE joined the voluntary US Environmental Protection Agency-sponsored Climate Leaders initiative and developed a comprehensive GHG Inventory Management and Reduction Program which included corporate-wide emissions reporting, the establishment of a reduction goal and a strategy for achieving the goal While the EPAs program was discontinued in late 2011, its methodology was based on the World Resources Institute and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WRI/WBCSD) GHG Protocol for data collection and analysis  Chubb still actively uses this methodology today Using the Climate Leaders methodology, ACE set a GHG reduction goal of 8% per employee from 2006 to 2012 and this goal was achieved three years ahead of schedule with a total reduction of 30% per employee Based on these achievements, ACE announced a new corporate-wide greenhouse gas reduction goal in 2014: a 10% reduction in emissions per employee from 2012 to 2020 Through 2015, ACE reduced global GHG emissions by 5% per employee from 2012 A new GHG reduction goal will be announced to reflect the combined companys real estate footprint and GHG inventory 

To achieve our GHG reduction goal, Chubb will aggressively work to make reductions within the organization The majority of Chubbs emissions  approximately 70%  result from electricity use (data centers, plug loads, lighting, etc) and stationary combustion (oil/natural gas) by our offices As a result, Chubbs Corporate Environmental Program focuses primarily on reducing our energy consumption at the facility level  specifically, in our owned buildings and larger, long-term leased spaces In 2017, Chubb voluntarily implemented several building efficiency projects including installation of new HVAC equipment, LED lighting as well as Building Automation System (BAS) upgrades and installation Due to green building efforts, Chubbs Philadelphia building has reduced energy consumption more than 20% since 2006 through the installation of new boilers, LED lighting, efficient ventilation equipment and variable speed drive HVAC equipment The building earned LEED Silver certification through the US Green Building Council in August 2009 and, in November 2014, achieved Gold certification In July 2011, the companys Bermuda office earned LEED Gold certification due in large part to re-lamping of office lights, applying a floating temperature set point and installing motion sensors and timers on office equipment These actions reduced electrical needs by approximately 500,000 kilowatt-hours (358 metric tons of CO2e) per year In early 2017, Chubbs Bermuda office recertified to Gold using the LEED Dynamic Plaque, a tool that continuously monitors and encourages improvement of overall building performance Chubb furthered its commitment to reducing emissions by earning Energy Star designations for the Wilmington, Del, Philadelphia, Pa and Whitehouse Station, NJ offices in 2016 Also in 2014, Chubb created a targeted energy policy for its operations in Europe, a region that includes 19 countries The policy aims to reduce GHG emissions by establishing building energy benchmarking and pursuing short-term objectives that reduce energy consumption within the region As part of this policy, Chubb has conducted an energy audit at the London, UK office, for example, and identified GHG reduction opportunities that were implemented in 2015 Similar efforts were completed in several other owned and long-term leased offices including Monterrey, Mexico, the Chubb Conference Center and ACE Club, and Whitehouse Station, NJ  Energy conservation measures discovered from these energy audits are implemented in order to reduce GHG emissions from these buildings  

Another approach to reducing our GHG emissions is through decreasing our overall real estate square footage by condensing office locations and increasing the efficiency of work spaces Applying new company standards for the number and size of office and cubicle spaces not only reduces total real estate per-person, but allows more light into the space, which decreases electricity consumption Chubb also manages its flight-related emissions by operating ultra-modern jet aircraft equipped with the latest engines, wings and avionic design technologies, making them leaders in their respective aircraft categories for efficient flying These advanced capabilities allow Chubbs aircraft to operate at very high altitudes and consume less fuel These advanced aircraft also fly optimal routes, which have shorter distances between world destinations, saving fuel and ultimately the release of GHGs In addition, Chubb reports its GHG emissions data and related activities to CDP (formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project), an independent, not-for-profit organization that gathers and scores primary corporate carbon emissions information for thousands of businesses around the world Chubbs 2017 submission to the CDP resulted in a score of A-",0

HDI-Gerling America Insurance Company," 2, above, in that the process for identifying climate change risks and assessing their potential impact must be viewed from two different standpoints  First, the companys physical facilities and method of operation as a property and casualty insurance company whose only product is insurance policies, is easiest to assess  Climate change, in the companys view, does not pose a significant risk to the companys operations and ongoing viability  The companys physical operations are limited to certain office building premises as described above  Those office leases make provision for the climate control, maintenance and habitability of each office space  These factors do not, in the companys view, carry significant financial implications

Second, identifying climate change-related risks and assessing their potential financial impact should be viewed from the standpoint of the company as a commercial property and casualty insurer  The companys customers/policyholders involved in industrial operations may require insurance products that take climate change-related activity into account  For liability casualty insurance products, this could involve expanded coverage for liability to third parties arising out of operations that allegedly impact climate change in some respects  For property insurance products, this may involve expanded catastrophe coverage to respond to climate-change related events such as the increased risk of severe storms  The company loss control personnel will devote increased time and attention to policyholders facilities as to emissions and other factors related to climate change, and the results of those inspections will be factored into the premiums charged to policyholders  Similarly, policyholders facilities will simultaneously be inspected for their physical facilities ability to withstand increased risks related to climate change, such as severe weather events  These heightened risks related to climate change will again be factored into premiums and limits of insurance such that the company can mitigate the degree of risk accordingly  Further, the company will monitor concentration and diversification of risks among various geographic areas to guard against concentration of climate change-related risks in areas more susceptible to climate-related events  The company uses catastrophe modeling initiated by its parent group in Hannover, Germany and applied to the groups risks worldwide, including specifically to the company in the United States  The nature and diversification of these risks are constantly evaluated by the company at the committee level  Also, in the event of a claim, the company will take facts regarding emissions or climate change into account when setting a reserve so that adequate funds are set aside to respond to the claim  Similarly, the company can also use such claims data to set reserves for claims that are incurred but not reported (IBNR)  Many of the companys policyholders, however, are referred to the company by the companys parent group  To the extent possible based on the groups international business model, the company will consult with the parent group regarding sufficient diversification of US risks",2

Foremost Property & Casualty Insurance Company," As an organization, Farmers recognizes that it is essential that we consider the impact we have on the environment, and that we create and foster a culture where all individuals are aware of opportunities to conserve energy and natural resources

We have initiatives in process that reduce our carbon footprint These include changes in the way we manage our facilities, our fleet, and our travel

Our goal is to purchase energy in an efficient, cost effective and environmentally responsible manner, and to establish and implement effective energy management programs

Our facility in Caledonia, MI, has replaced existing HID parking lot and road lights with more energy efficient LED lighting, and reduced the number of light heads on poles These LED fixtures are typically 50% - 75% more energy efficient and have a useful life of 72,000 hours (82 years with 24/7 use) There will be continued energy savings with projected carbon savings over the next 10 years of 2,145 tonnes CO2 In 2015 we have installed the same energy efficient lighting in Lake Mary, FL, which will result in continued energy reduction saving in Kilowatt usage per year 59,900 kWh/yr In 2014 we replaced all of the parking lot lighting in our LEED certified Oklahoma City, OK facility with LED Net energy savings is 133,634 kilowatts/yr We also replaced the Lobby lighting, workstation lighting, and display case lighting with LED We have previously installed a new Cool Roof product at one of our facilities and have installed solar panels in two other locations We continue to implement electrical power conservation programs in multiple operations In some locations we have installed motion sensitive light switches and energy saving light bulbs (such as ALTO lights from Phillips, which are recognized by the industry as energy-efficient lighting solutions) In Austin, TX we have converted our 190,000 sq ft office and also our 9,000 sq ft office in McAllen, TX over to 100% green electricity through electricity provider contracts We will continue to look for additional opportunities, where available In Grand Rapids, MI we have replaced (4) 25+ year old elevators with more energy efficient elevators which are projected to save $5,000 annually in electricity costs In addition to these improvements, we have also implemented programs to remind employees to power down equipment when it is not in use Many computer monitors and desktop computers are automatically set to go into a sleep or hibernation mode after a short period of inactivity

Depending on job assignment, employees may be provided with a company fleet vehicle Since 2010, more fuel efficient, 4 cylinder vehicles have been selected for our general lines vehicles and the number of unassigned and pool vehicles at our various office locations has been reduced Gallons of fuel and tons of CO2 emitted in 2016 were 41% lower than 2015  A 55% reduction in the total tons of CO2 over this six year time period has been attained due to fewer vehicles in service, fewer miles driven and the decision to down-size from full-size to mid-size and compact vehicles

As many Farmers employees commute to our business locations, we encourage ridesharing and the use of public transportation In some locations, we provide incentives including subsidies for train passes, bus passes and vanpools, free shuttle buses from train stations, and preferred carpool parking spaces Farmers has also installed five electric charging stations at two facilities in California to provide an energy source for those employees who already drive electric vehicles and to also encourage more environmentally friendly vehicle use

Telepresence technology and high quality HD video conferencing systems in many operations have helped minimize airline travel

In addition to our focus on the reduction of emissions we have made improvements in our effort to reduce water consumption Improvements include low volume sink faucets, low volume toilets, and waterless urinals Other improvements within our operations include upgrades to programmable irrigation systems and pop-up sprinkler heads, which eliminate leakage and overspray We have also transitioned to zero scape in some locations

We continue to work on reducing utilization of paper and office supplies Copier/printer machines in many of our locations are set for duplex (two-sided) printing and the print/copy default has been set to black and white vs color Farmers has implemented an MDS optimization program within Document Logistics, replacing multi-functional devises with more energy efficient equipment This program was put into place not only to reduce energy consumption and the impact on the environment, but to also ensure cost savings We are in the third year of the program and continue to reduce both the number and size of the multifunction devices (MFD) in our facilities Through YE 2016 we have reduced the number of multifunction devices (MFD) from 3,329 to 1,401 (58% reduction) Replacement machines are right sized and more energy efficient The overall result is a 2,068,445 lb (73%) reduction in CO2 emissions and a 1,313,100 kWh (71%) reduction in electricity usage over the 3 year period

Virtually all employee communications are handled electronically rather than through paper As of 2011, semi-monthly statements of employee earnings and deductions have been electronically available and are no longer printed and mailed to employees Improved ordering processes have lowered the volume of consumable supplies in many locations Recycling programs have been implemented for paper, plastic, cardboard and glass Printer, copier ink and toner cartridges are also recycled, as are cell phones, chargers and obsolete electronic equipment such as computers and monitors  In our mail rooms, we have begun recycling and reusing packing materials for shipping

We have implemented initiatives that provide customers with environmentally friendly choices that also reduce the organizations carbon footprint For example, in some operations, mail sent to agents and customers is delivered in envelopes made of recycled material A new billing system available in some states and for some products provides increased on-line billing and payment capabilities  In some states and for some products, we are working to provide customers with the option to receive electronic policy forms and notices from us, rather than paper copies Customers with these electronic policies may also have the option to receive bills, pay bills, and view their billing histories online
Some states prohibit the use of paperless communication with policyholders, which limits our ability to consider paperless options

Our MultiCar auto policy, available in some states, can cover multiple vehicles on one policy, thereby reducing the amount of paper customers receive and our overall carbon footprint

In 2010, Farmers built a 164,000 SF facility in Oklahoma City that was recognized by the US Green Building Council as qualifying for Core and Shell LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) certification at the silver level, and also qualified for LEED certification for the Tenant Improvement portion of the project 1400 employees moved into the building in October 2010 and continue to work there today

In some of our larger facilities: 1) ice and water machines are provided, reducing plastic bottled water consumption; 2) programmable thermostats are in place; 3) carbon footprint studies and energy audits have been completed; 4) Energy Star equipment is purchased whenever practical; 5) cleaning hours were revised to allow for more daytime cleaning, allowing us to deactivate interior lights earlier in the evening; 6) new employees are informed of our green business practices during their initial training classes and existing employees receive regular electronic communications on various energy-related topics, keeping awareness at a high level 7) In 2016 our large facility in Washington started a composting program as part of its waste services in the café and all kitchenettes

In addition the two Print and Distribution Centers in North America have implemented several significant initiatives to mitigate impacts to the environment including: aggressive approach to deliver agent, customer and broker documents electronically versus traditional USPS mail; On-line report viewing; purchasing of envelopes and stationary manufactured with paper from trees harvested from forests that are SFI (Sustainable Forestry Initiative) certified, Print-On-Demand of agent support materials versus warehoused stored materials; digitizing as much in-bound mail as possible via an active imaging approach; implemented many initiatives improving efficiency, lowering energy consumption, actively participating in operational recycling program, consolidating operations to a two-site COE model and reducing operational waste from 4% to less than 2%

FMH AG RISK INSURANCE CO," In the majority of instances our policies are both crop related (and thus modeled based on actual history), or are not insurance risks based on hurricane modeling (hurricane modeling does involve more climate related science) Modeling based on loss cost history remains our focus

This concludes our survey response Future correspondence regarding this matter can be directed to me at the address indicated above

Aetna Better Health of Kansas Inc," We recognize the opportunity we have as a leader in health care to manage our climate change impacts and advance our purpose of helping people on their path to better health As a provider of prescription medication and retail health services, we also understand that a major disruption in our business can have serious implications for customers and patients who rely on us for their health care needs Therefore, climate-related issues have had an influence on our business objectives and strategy, in particular as they relate to our Enterprise Response and Resiliency (ERR) programs 
We have committed to a science-based emissions reduction target (SBT) that defines our emissions trajectory until 2030 This target informs various elements of our business and operational strategy including continuous improvement in sustainable operations, sustainable products and packaging, and internal/external engagement around our sustainability vision
To achieve our SBT, we continue to invest in energy efficiency measures at our retail locations, at our logistics hubs, and with our transportation systems, as well as to engage with our top suppliers to encourage them to set their own SBTs
The most substantial business decisions made during the reporting year that have been influenced by climate change driven aspects of our strategy include our continued investment in our ERR program, including the creation of the CVS Health Operations Center (CHOC) Climate-related weather risks are monitored 24 hours a day, seven days a week through our CHOC Staff in the CHOC are trained to monitor the current threat landscape utilizing a combination of open source data as well as leveraging Enterprise Risk Event Monitoring visualization software Additionally, the commencement of climate-related scenario analysis, as well as the addition of a new role Sr Manager, Sustainability Analytics & Corporate Social Responsibility, were substantial business decisions made during the reporting year that were influenced by the climate change driven aspects of our strategy These decisions will allow us to integrate climate-related issues into our business strategy  
The aspects of climate change that have influenced our decision to invest in our ERR program is the need for climate change adaptation and mitigation, and to manage both acute and chronic physical risks Our investments in ERR help us adapt to a changing climate and maintain business continuity through severe weather events Through our SBT we do our part to mitigate global emissions

Homesite Insurance Company of Georgia,"  However Homesite does encourage policyholders to prevent or mitigate losses caused by covered perils, whether or not the losses could be attributed to climate change  This includes offering mitigation discounts in some states to customers that make use of storm shutters or other construction features to reduce the risk of loss due to hurricane  For customers in areas prone to hurricanes and wildfires, Homesite sends informational emails and tweets that outline methods home owners can adopt to increase the durability and safety of homes to natural perils at the start of the season as well as several times during the season  In addition, Homesite posts similar informational articles on its website  At the time of major weather events, most often hurricanes, Homesite will contact customers by e-mail and phone to warn of the event and provide safety tips for protecting life and property during the event

Homesite is a member of the Insurance Institute for Business and Home Safety (IBHS)  The following text, prepared by IBHS, is a brief description of the Institute and some of its activities that relate to the issue of climate change
IBHS is a 501(c)(3) organization, wholly supported by the property (re)insurance industry, which conducts objective, scientific research to identify and promote effective actions that strengthen homes, businesses and communities against natural disasters and other causes of loss IBHS does this by identifying and advocating improved property design, construction, retrofitting, maintenance, repair, and preparation practices  IBHS guidance for mitigating property losses is available directly to the public and to our members/policyholders, at wwwdisastersafetyorg, and through social media (eg, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, YouTube and Vimeo)
IBHS advocates the concept of going green and building strong recognizing that addressing climate change involves reducing greenhouse gas emissions and adapting homes, businesses, and communities to severe weather that may result from climate change:
	As an insurance-supported organization, IBHS recognizes that climate change strategies must do more than build structures to be energy efficient  They must be built to modern fire protection standards to help resist fire and avoid the water/chemical deluge needed for fire suppression; they should be strong enough to avoid wind destruction and resulting relocation in landfills; and properties should be sited and elevated in a manner that protects against flooding and environmental degradation from landslides  All of these are part of going green
	IBHS also firmly believes that adaptation is critical, not only to reduce long-term property insurance losses, but to buttress individual and societal resilience  All of the property protection measures that IBHS advocates to strengthen structures against current weather threats will also reduce future losses caused by climate change events  And, the unprecedented scientific research conducted at the unique IBHS Research Center is critical to identification of new mitigation actions that may help protect against more severe weather events
	Additionally, research conducted by IBHS will help to make sure that green building enhancements do not inadvertently cause structures to be less disaster-resistant, or even worse, threaten the life safety of occupants or first respondersfor example, photovoltaic arrays that take flight or pose fire suppression challenges are the antithesis of building strong  

As a building science institute, and due to antitrust concerns, IBHS does not have access to, and cannot compile, a list of market-based discounts offered by specific insurers with respect to current or future weather scenarios  That said, IBHS research helps its member companies to better understand structural vulnerability and the role that mitigation plays in reducing damage from severe weather, as well as what mitigation features to look for when inspecting a residential or commercial building
   
A few states (incl Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, Oklahoma, and South Carolina) have developed legislative or regulatory discount frameworks for homes built or retrofitted to the code-plus, hazard-specific FORTIFIED new construction and retrofit standards developed by IBHS  In these states, the Institute has worked with insurance regulators and insurance companies to make sure that the discount programs work as they were intended upon enactment, and actually facilitate risk-based pricing, which can serve both to encourage effective mitigation and discourage unsound development in disaster-prone areas 

In 2014, our parent American Family, partnered with IBHS through a first-of-its-kind national study that will support researchers over the next 25 years in making residential roofs last longer and leak less often ultimately helping customers mitigate risks The study will determine how Midwest weather affects different brands of roofing material, using a dozen small roof structures built on a bare patch of ground at American Familys corporate headquarters

Rochdale Insurance Co.," As such our climate change risk is considered low, due to the risk taking place over much longer time horizons The corporate bonds portfolio is well diversified by sector and issuer and the impact of climate change, if any, on the creditworthiness of any issuer is insignificant in the context of the whole portfolio 

We believe climate risk is a consideration tempered by a relatively short duration portfolio which would allow us to react quickly to any effects of climate risk should they begin to emerge",4
Indian Harbor Insurance Company," As we focus on solving clients' most complex insurance risk problems, we heighten their awareness regarding potential advancements in their own area of expertise As some of the worlds most complex risk problems exist today because of climate c
s closely with corporate clients to help them translating climate hazards into a risk, which means quantifying the physical and economic impacts of climate change on their assets and business operations and implementing appropriate risk metrics into decision-making process AXA XL Risk Consulting services models the unique vulnerability of assets to hazards, eg estimate the physical damage associated to a given flood water depth, and quantify a wide range of direct and indirect economic consequences, such as the property damage associated with the said flood, the risk of disruption of the upstream supply chain or downstream distribution, the risk of interruption of production Some recent examples of analyses performed by risk consulting to support AXA XL clients are: 
	natural hazards prioritization analysis, aimed to identify regions and sites  among a clients portfolio, or supply chain  potentially more affected by natural hazards, as of today and due to climate change in the next 30 years; 
	water stress risk assessment, ie the assessment of potential water shortage and related impacts on business continuity and communities, as of today and in the next 30 years 
In addition to risk assessment, risk engineering is also able to support clients in tailoring the best risk mitigation strategy, and identify which countermeasures should be taken to control losses, or accelerate the pace and scale of adaptation, for instance reducing the physical vulnerability of assets by retrofitting, identifying alternate suppliers, creating backup stocks, or transfer risks, etc

Within AXA XL we have taken steps to encourage policyholders to reduce the losses caused by climate change-influenced events Our property risk consultants evaluate policyholders property exposures and provide recommendations to reduce the potential for property losses from natural catastrophe events (including hurricane, storm surge, earthquake and flood events) 

We have also helped our customers manage the fire peril This includes advice to reduce carbon emissions from the fires smoke plume, managing firefighting water runoff, the need to remanufacture damaged building materials, inventory, and equipment, and the need to place damaged material that cannot be recycled in a landfill 

We have approximately 300 risk professionals across AXA XL This includes Account Consultants that help clients to understand their portfolio, manage their risk and prioritize risk improvement activities; as well as Property, Machinery Breakdown, Construction and Environmental Loss Prevention Consultants in the field globally, who visit our customers key locations to help identify and mitigate risk These risks include pre-emergency planning and preparation, as well as developing recommendations on how to further improve site protection Specific areas of focus in wind-prone areas include detailed wind inspections to help our customers ensure they have the necessary protection in place to withstand hurricane-force winds Another key activity our consultants focus on is categorizing the flood hazard for every location they visit For those locations in flood-prone areas, they conduct detailed Flood Loss Estimates as well as survey current protection in place and recommend enhancements AXA XL has invested in their state-of-the-art Global Risk Maps tool, that gives consultants access to multiple flood assessment sources of information AXA XL Risk Consulting also has an active partnership with the University of Naples Federico II for flood and earthquake research

We regularly advise our clients on how to ensure that well-meaning energy saving products do not adversely contribute to a fire or make the facility more vulnerable to natural catastrophe losses We advise them on how to quickly recover from losses that do occur, which includes pre-planned and engineered environmental remediation strategies In addition, AXA XL is a member of the Insurance Institute for Business & Home Safety (IBHS), which identifies and promotes effective actions that strengthen homes, businesses, and communities against natural disasters and other causes of loss

Insurance products represent an important tool to mitigate the impacts that climate change-related events have on our clients business and on countries economies Yet the difference between economic and insured losses (the protection gap), particularly in developing markets that are disaster-prone, remains significant As an active member of organizations like InsuResilience and the Insurance Development Forum (IDF), AXA as well as AXA XL, dedicate significant efforts to help close the protection gap The IDF brings together private sector insurers, reinsurers and brokers, together with the World Bank and the United Nations Development Program, with the aim to support the G20 InsuResilience objective of insuring 400m more people in emerging countries by 2020 against climate-related disasters and of improving their climate resilience AXA XL plays an active part in this  effort In addition, as Chairman of the IDF, AXA Chairman Denis Duverne regularly speaks at conferences and events dedicated to raising awareness of climate related risk in the industry and beyond

Several insurance products underwritten by AXA XL serve to encourage policyholders to become more sustainable For example, AXA XLs Environmental Liability team in France offers two biodiversity-related products: an Environmental Risks policy covering Environmental Impairment Liability and Guarantee, and a M&A Environmental policy that facilitate the rehabilitation of former polluted industrials sites and help limit artificialization of soil and biodiversity loss In 2020, AXA XL France partnered with the broker Marsh to better preserve biodiversity by encouraging clients to carry out Biodiversity impact assessments and integrate the results into their accident risk prevention and management plan Joint clients with Marsh, meeting the above criteria, are offered a 25% reduction of the deductible for Environmental Risks policies

AXA XLs North America Construction business has developed tailored Builders Risk insurance programs to address clients mass timber project risks Mass timber, which includes cross-laminated timber (CLT) is gaining popularity in North America Its also considered a more sustainable building material; according to the Wood Council, replacing steel with mass timber would reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 15% to 20% The process of manufacturing timber uses substantially less fossil fuel energy per unit volume than steel, concrete, or aluminum, meaning that timber has a lower carbon footprint

Within AXA XL we share internally generated thought leadership through our online magazine Fast, Fast Forward, which includes articles produced by our environmental subject matter experts In 2020 for example, the Risk Consulting team published an article about preparing industrial facilities for the effects of wildfires The full article is available here:  https://axaxlcom/fast-fast-forward/articles/preparing-industrial-facilities-for-the-far-reaching-effects-of-wildfires

HISC Insurance Services Corporation,"   Note that a very large portion of the Companys investment portfolio consists of short-term investments 

The Company does not have a climate change policy with respect to risk management  Almost all of the Companys underwriting risk is subject to re-pricing on an annual basis  To the extent that climate change were impacting the morbidity of the Companys policyholders, that impact would likely be long-term in nature, as one of several factors influencing inflation in healthcare costs  As such, any impact of climate change on policyholder morbidity would implicitly be considered in the Companys normal pricing & underwriting process, without there being any need to explicitly identify climate change as the root cause of that morbidity change  Consequently, we believe that climate change is implicitly addressed within our normal risk management process and that there is no need for the Company to explicitly address climate change in our risk management

LM General Insurance Company," Below is an overview of Libertys energy reduction initiatives, recognitions, and awards

LEED Building Certification 
	Liberty Mutual has 5 LEED certified buildings and one under recertification and ENERGY STAR labels for eight buildings
	To meet the guidelines for these standards, the Company applies a wide range of energy efficiency strategies including the addition of energy-efficient bulbs that use under one watt of energy per square foot, automatic flush toilets and automatic water spouts, lighting control systems that turn lights off after business hours in all common hallways, and occupancy sensors that control lights in offices and conference rooms 
	As the Company builds new and retro-fits existing buildings to LEED standards, Liberty Mutual mandates that all construction contractors on its work sites follow indoor air quality guidelines and practices Examples include using recycled/recyclable carpet, low VOC (volatile organic compounds) adhesives, sealants, and paints Liberty Mutuals new 22-story Boston office building was designed to be more energy efficient than a typical large modern office building and has achieved LEED Silver certification 
	Liberty Mutual works in accordance to best practices established through USGBC related to water efficiency (eg low flow fixtures), materials and resources (USGBC approved products and sealants), energy (motion, LED lights), and indoor air quality Liberty Mutual also ensures that these areas also meet guidelines set by local municipalities and landlords 
	At the Companys Dover, NH facility, Liberty Mutual replaced all of the 1,000-watt metal halide parking lot lights with 288-watt LEDs lights for a savings of 712 watts per fixture and a cost reduction of $458 per light Overall, the LED lights have shown a 60 percent to 70 percent savings each month compared to the old metal halides Because of the success of the light replacement project in NH, Liberty Mutual recently installed 28 LED lights in its Weston office parking lot 
	In 2017 and 2018, the Company diverted over 127 tons of furniture from waste disposal and donated $743k in furniture to local nonprofit organizations and schools 
	By maintaining a focus on energy reduction initiatives as well as on implementing building operating best practices, Liberty Mutual continues to drive down overall energy consumption across its owned building portfolio 
	Liberty Mutual identifies opportunities to introduce its Aspirational Values throughout all Liberty Mutual offices through thoughtful design and consideration of the employee experience; elements include:
o	Access to Daylight: having fewer offices and conference rooms on the perimeter of facilities to allow employees to have access and work next to natural daylight
o	Circulation and Connectivity: active paths of travel that result in employee interaction; spaces designed for visual and physical connectivity to encourage interaction between employees; and central areas where employees can gather and eat healthy food options

Catering and Cafeteria 
	Liberty Mutual has two recycling programs for excess food in its Boston facility and implemented the same programs in its Plano, TX and other facilities in 2018 The programs are:
o	The Boston facility has a composter into which all unused food waste goes In 2018, 169 tons of organic waste was produced and recycled The compost is then donated to a local farm where it is bagged and sold as fertilizer
o	The Bring Your Own Cup Program was implemented to reduce disposable cup usage and switched the disposable cups from foam to paper
o	Liberty Mutual has implemented the use of compostable and re-usable dinner wares in the new Plano cafeteria; the Company continues to learn and where appropriate apply this policy to other cafeterias during major remodels or when opening new locations 
o	The Companys cafeteria partner, Eurest, has a sustainability program that includes sourcing fish from a sustainable supply chain, adjusting menu options to be more sustainable (example: less beef, more produce), using Imperfectly Delicious Produce (produce that would be discarded in the field because it is not cosmetically perfect), cage-free eggs, reducing the amount of wasted food during preparation, sourcing ingredients locally if possible, etc

Paper, Printing, and Office Supplies
	The Companys Records Management department works closely with a record storage vendor to shred and recycle files eligible for destruction Through its secure shredding program, in 2018 Liberty Mutual recycled 2,087 short tons of paper, which were transported to paper mills for pulping resulting in the following eco-friendly results: 3,022,659 pounds of CO2 avoided, 35,027 trees saved, 57 million gallons of water conserved, and approximately 10,437 cubic yards of landfill space conserved
	Through Print$mart, in 2018, employees conserved 18 million gallons of water, saved 20,934 trees, reduced CO2 emissions by 2,482 tons, and reduced greenhouse gas emissions by 872 tons
	Office supply order minimums cuts down on emissions by reducing the number of deliveries Further, we purchase office supplies that are manufactured with an average of 37% post-consumer content During 2018, these initiatives saved 400,000 gallons of water, 720 trees, and 83,066 pounds of CO2 Note: Liberty Mutuals partner vendor no longer calculates kWh saved 

Auto Program and Commuting 
	100% of Liberty Mutuals automotive fleet consists of either PZEV (partial zero emission vehicle) or flex-fuel vehicles 
	In 2018, the Company reduced its fleet by 43%, reduced miles driven by 86%, increased MPG by 04%, and decreased gallons consumed by 87% The Company has continued to transition its fleet from six- to four-cylinder vehicles; as of year-end 2018, 88% of vehicles are four-cylinder, up from 62% at the end of 2017, resulting in a reduction of 1,6456 tons CO2 emissions 
	Liberty Mutual offers employees the ability to purchase pre-tax transit and monthly parking permits and encourages employee usage of commuting alternatives to driving alone 
	At office locations with the largest employee populations, Liberty Mutual has partnerships with local transit agencies and other stakeholders to tailor its employee commuter amenities to the commuting demographic of the area Some of these offerings include priority rideshare parking, electrical charging stations, commuter counseling, as well as lockers and showers for cyclists and those who commute by foot 
	Through these efforts, Liberty Mutual is aiding employees with their commutes and meeting the various state trip reduction regulations These regulations are state, county, or city specific and require businesses of certain sizes to achieve a defined reduction of single occupant commuting vehicles These efforts also help Liberty Mutual contribute to national standards regarding the reduction of carbon emissions

American Heritage Life Insurance Company," To better prepare for inevitable natural catastrophes, Allstate recommends an improved system of catastrophe preparedness and protection that is financially sound and organized to efficiently utilize the resources and expertise of private and public entities, including those of local, state, and federal governments Currently, a significant gap exists between the available coverage and necessary protection for major natural catastrophes because of the limited capacity of the private insurance and reinsurance sectors and the financial burden caused by these catastrophes

A national backstop for state catastrophe funds that is fully funded by a portion of private insurance premiums would increase the private insurance market's ability to respond to large-scale natural catastrophes The plan we support would not eliminate private reinsurance, which allows insurance companies to spread the risk of catastrophic losses and which is essential to the private insurance market Private reinsurers will continue to play an integral role in the insurance market, and private reinsurers will be encouraged to participate in providing capacity to the national backstop This plan would spread risk even more and provide a guaranteed source of reinsurance protection after major events or a series of events that could destabilize the market or even threaten a private market collapse  The plan we support will provide additional, needed capacity to the market, above and beyond what the private reinsurance market provides It will not eliminate private reinsurance; it will supplement it

Allstate specifically supports the Homeowners and Taxpayers Protection Act of 2013 (HR noi) because it includes the features of the plan we have discussed in these comments This legislation was drafted with input from experts in catastrophe management and actuarial science and improves upon similar legislation introduced in the past The sooner this legislation becomes law, the sooner and the better we can prepare and protect America from future natural catastrophes

Allstate also engages consumers and customers on the topic of disaster preparedness through vehicles like the Allstate Slog (http://blogallstatecom/), allstatecom (http://wwwallstatecom/tools-and-resources/be-aware-and¬prepareaspx), and the distribution of disaster preparation and awareness brochures to customers by agency owners

Allstate is a member of and actively supports ProtectingAmericaorg ProtectingAmericaorg is a national coalition of more than 300 organizations representing emergency management experts, first responders, disaster relief agencies, non-profits, businesses, and insurers that believes that a comprehensive solution is needed to better prepare and protect America from future catastrophes
Allstate publicly discloses all identified climate related risks through the CDP annually

The Hanover American Insurance Company," Regular updates are provided to the corporate Group Risk Committee (GRC), Aggregation Working Group (AWG) and Enterprise Risk Management Group (ERMG)  consisting of business leaders from different functions and businesses who are collectively responsible for monitoring and managing all material risks to the company 

	We closely follow the research and analysis being conducted by several industry bodies, universities and weather experts We constantly analyze historical data and trends to identify possible signs of climate change impacting both catastrophe and non-catastrophe weather related losses 

The enterprise risk team completed a climate change assessment across four work-streams including insurability; investments; transition risk and societal change and disclosure  Recommendations from this work have been discussed with the GRC and Audit Committee of The Hanovers Board of Directors  These recommendations will contribute to furthering our Environmental, Societal and Governance (ESG) initiatives through participation on a new ESG Council to be led by the General Counsel  The organization expects to be a fast follower with respect to climate change disclosure and is actively monitoring the various disclosure frameworks including the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) framework The ESG Council demonstrates The Hanovers commitment to raising the profile of risks associated with climate change

	Sensitivity tests using catastrophe models like AIR and RMS are used to assess the impact of climate change on our exposure We have also built internal tools that help us analyze different frequencies and severities of storms by region and study the possible impact on our modeled losses

LifeMap," However, there is a heightened awareness within the ERM function on climate change and health risks With the ever changing landscape of health care risks, the ERM function constantly updates Cambias risk universe and its risk categories for better identification, classification, and management of enterprise wide risks Climate risks are currently classified under the Corporate Responsibility and Sustainability category within our risk universe However, at this point in time, we have not identified any climate risks that would impede achievement of our strategic objective

The risks of climate change on Cambias health insurance operations relate primarily to any resulting increases in average morbidity rates Changes in morbidity risks are monitored through existing risk management practices and measured against pricing assumptions Cambia monitors risks and impairments to its investment portfolio on an ongoing basis  With respect to asset management we do not have a direct or exclusive risk assessment related to climate change We do regularly review both our liquidity, capital, and income needs of our investment portfolio as a part of a regular investment risk assessment and risk tolerance setting process, which considers a variety of potential risks and impacts It is, in fact, the unknown future costs, impacts, and needs which along with the effect of climate change risk, whether related to underwriting or other factors, represent another reason to maintain strong surplus levels to ensure ability to continue meeting the needs of our members

MAPFRE Insurance Company," 

	Attached to this survey as Exhibit 2 is a summary describing the Companys Environment and Energy Policy



The sustainability concept has been embedded in MAPFREs values since its origins, and is expressly included in its Code of Good Governance The Environmental Policy, which all of the Group's employees must adhere to and respect, is the expression of this commitment to sustainable development, which is also enshrined in MAPFRE's Code of Ethics and Conduct
MAPFREs Environmental and Energy Policy is based on three cornerstones: 



















 
ENCOURAGING ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSIBILITY
(GRI: 414-417; DJSI: 252, FTSE4Good)
As a global company MAPFREs environmental commitment is also focused on promoting environmental responsibility among employees, suppliers, customers and business managers, public and private associations and organisations and other stakeholders connected to MAPFREs activity, involving them in the achievement of goals, developing awareness actions and good practices, contributing to the development and dissemination of scientific knowledge and participating in environmental forums
Public bodies and authorities
MAPFRE participates in the main sustainability forums, such as the United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative (UNEP FI) and the Global Compact It is also very active in other forums, such as the National Congress of the Environment (CONAMA) and participates in conferences and working groups related to the analysis and evaluation of environmental risks, climate change and greenhouse gases MAPFRE also participates in initiatives designed to raise the publics awareness of the challenges posed by sustainable development and the risks associated with climate change
An example of this has been the participation, for the fourth year, in Earth Hour, in which the MAPFRE companies in Brazil, Mexico, Puerto Rico, Argentina, Colombia and Spain have taken part In addition to participating in this initiative with the symbolic gesture of turning off the company's neon signs and its advertising billboard lights for one hour in 34 main buildings and 204 commercial offices, employees have been encouraged through the Corporate Portal to take part from their homes
The Group also backs global environmental programmes such as the Carbon Disclosure Project, of which MAPFRE is a signatory, and in whose 2012 ""Iberia 125"" report it has advanced 11 points to an 83 disclosure score, and a C-band performance score
A broad range of measures has been adopted in Brazil and Puerto Rico (the companies there are implementing the Corporate Environmental Strategic Plan), with many more planned in the short term in these two countries and the United States
Suppliers
As established by the Principles for Sustainable Insurance, Environmental Responsibility is propagated in the value chain MAPFRE contributes to its suppliers' environmental performance by establishing selection criteria that assess their environmental conduct, and by ensuring that environmental clauses feature systematically in contracts Environmental clauses in bidding specifications help to foster sustainability in suppliers, as do sustainability criteria in procurement specifications and in the matrices used for comparing tenders, with particular attention to large corporate supplies 
In addition, it issues guidelines to suppliers of businesses or services that impact the environment and operate in environmentally certified work centres with a view to informing them of best practice in their business lines
Compliance with these measures is audited by MAPFREs in-house audit department
Meanwhile, MAPFREs Environmental Services suppliers form part of a constant evaluation process that guarantees the continuity of their authorizations and their service capacity
 
Employees
(GRI: 414-417, FS4; DJSI: 252, FTSE4Good)
MAPFRE employees in Spain received 2,693 hours of environmental training in 2012 MAPFREs environmental commitment remains a core component of the corporate training that all employees follow In addition, MAPFREs environmental department takes part as a speaker in a range of environmental training courses given to third parties
During 2012, participation in the Car Sharing project, which encourages employees to share private vehicles for their everyday journey to work, was even easier thanks to direct access on the en Persona corporate portal
Employee participation has been essential in the Green Signature project carried out in 2012 to establish a corporate awareness message on printing emails, with a winner to be selected from the 594 creative proposals sent by MAPFRE employees from 29 countries
General information on MAPFREs Environmental and Energy Policy can be accessed in the Internal Website Employee Area A special section with information and precise indications on environmental management and energy saving has also been created in this space for application in certain work centres
MAPFREs environment portal received more than 400 visits in 2012, and includes an environmental suggestion box which registered 55 enquiries during the year
Any enquiry or suggestion regarding MAPFREs environmental record can be addressed to the following e-mail address  medioambiente@mapfrecom


MAPFRE has adhered to the Principles for Sustainable Insurance promoted by the United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative (UNEPFI) that were presented at Rio+20 Sustainable Development summit, held in Río de Janeiro (Brazil)
This initiative seeks to bring into business management, as a risk and an opportunity, environmental issues such as climate change, damage to biodiversity and ecosystem degradation, water management and pollution; social aspects related to financial inclusion, human rights, health risks arising from development and population aging, and issues related to corporate governance, regulatory compliance, ethical management, conflicts of interest and transparency These are referred to as the ESG factors
The Principles for Sustainable Insurance represent the first global framework for the world's insurance industry that takes account of the economic impact of such aspects on the business MAPFRE is one of the world's 30 leading insurers that form part of this initiative, which together have a total of $5 billion of assets and 100% of the world's premium volume
 
The Principles for Sustainable Insurance are: 
1	Embed in decision-making environmental, social and governance issues relevant to the insurance business
2	Work together with clients and business partners to raise awareness of environmental, social and governance issues, manage risk and develop solutions
3	Work together with governments, regulators and other key stakeholders to promote widespread action across society on environmental, social and governance issues
4	Demonstrate accountability and transparency in regularly disclosing publicly progress in implementing the Principles
Each of these Principles includes concrete actions to improve risk management in companies, promote best practices and encourage innovative insurance solutions  http://wwwunepfiorg/psi/#sliderName




One of the cornerstones of the insurance business and one of MAPFREs strengths is its efficient risk management, which has helped the Group become one of the most solid and solvent multinational industry players
MAPFRE has a risk management system (SGR) based on the end-to-end management of each and every identified business process and on matching risk assumption to strategic targets The different risk groups have been classified in four categories: operational, financial, insurance related business risks and strategic/corporate governance Within this system, environmental, social and governance risks (ESG risks) are included partly under operational risks and partly under strategic & corporate governance risk factors


OPERATIONAL RISKS
 
STRATEGIC AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE RISKS
 
The risk policy and the systems in place to manage and control risk are outlined in the notes to the consolidated financial statements (pages XX of the Annual Accounts) 
For environmental risks, MAPFRE has an Environmental and Energy Policy defined and a Safety and Environmental Committee responsible for its implementation It also contributes towards the efficient management of environmental risk in company by launching products and services which meet its customers needs
For strategic and corporate governance risks, apart from the Code of Good Governance, MAPFRE has a Code of Ethics and Conduct which reflects its corporate values and business principles It has created an Ethics to implement, monitor and control the Code, helping to minimise risks in this area Committee to implement, monitor and control the Code, helping to minimise risks in this area

Horace Mann Property and Casualty Insurance Company," Climate change, to the extent it produces rising temperatures and changes in weather patterns, could impact the frequency and severity of weather events and wildfires, the affordability and availability of our catastrophe reinsurance coverage and our results of operations If an increase in weather events and/or wildfires were to occur, in addition to the attendant increase in claim costs, which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition, concentrations of insurance risk could impact our ability to make property insurance available to our customers This could adversely impact our volume of business and our results of operations or cash flows The potential for new laws and regulations associated with climate change or associated with trying to anticipate potential issues linked directly or indirectly to climate change also could have an adverse impact on our cost of doing business, our results of operations or cash flows, and by extension, the ultimate cost of our insurance products

In order to manage our reinsurance costs as well as our retained losses after consideration of reinsurance, both now and in the future, we have processes in place to regularly monitor our exposure distribution We monitor the percent of our exposures that we consider coastal and we also evaluate exposure concentrations in non-coastal areas, to ensure an acceptable distribution of risk We evaluate our catastrophe losses on a weekly basis We also review catastrophe modeling results on our book of business twice annually

Kaiser Foundation Health Plan of Washington Options,"
The Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) concluded in 2013 that an increase in extreme weather events, coupled with the spread of infectious diseases, and food and water scarcity, are likely to present material implications for the managed care industry through an increase in covered medical expenses SASB also noted that an increase in the frequency of extreme weather events has the potential to impact costs and liabilities by generating additional covered medical expenses and that the associated risks could lead to an increased cost of capital Higher incidence of disease could negatively affect both clinical and non-clinical staff availability, resulting in higher expenditures on sick leave and backfilling The financial implications of these health-related impacts are difficult to quantify Changes in physical climate may also affect the efficiency of our facility operations, including increased power and water consumption necessary to maintain the indoor environment of our hospitals and patient care buildings
According to the US Global Change Research Programs published 2016 scientific assessment of the impacts of climate change on human health in the United States:
Current and future climate impacts expose more people in more places to public health threats Already in the United States, we have observed climate-related increases in our exposure to elevated temperatures; more frequent, severe, or longer-lasting extreme events; degraded air quality; diseases transmitted through food, water, and disease vectors (such as ticks and mosquitoes); and stresses to our mental health and well-being Almost all of these threats are expected to worsen with continued climate change Some of these health threats will occur over longer time periods, or at unprecedented times of the year; some people will be exposed to threats not previously experienced in their locations Overall, instances of potentially beneficial health impacts of climate change are limited in number and pertain to specific regions or populations For example, the reduction in cold-related deaths is projected to be smaller than the increase in heat-related deaths in most regions Every American is vulnerable to the health impacts associated with climate change Increased exposure to multiple health threats, together with changes in sensitivity and the ability to adapt to those threats, increases a persons vulnerability to climate-related health effects The impacts of climate change on human health interact with underlying health, demographic, and socioeconomic factors Through the combined influence of these factors, climate change exacerbates some existing health threats and creates new public health challenges While all Americans are at risk, some populations are disproportionately vulnerable, including those with low income, some communities of color, immigrant groups (including those with limited English proficiency), Indigenous peoples, children and pregnant women, older adults, vulnerable occupational groups, persons with disabilities, and persons with preexisting or chronic medical conditions 
In the April 4, 2013 edition of the New England Journal of Medicine, McMichael identifies three categories of climate-change risks to health, along with their causal pathway:
1	Primary: Direct biologic consequences of heat waves, extreme weather events, and temperature-enhanced levels of urban air pollutants;
2	Secondary: Risks mediated by changes in biophysically and ecologically based processes and systems, particularly food yields, water flows, infectious-disease vectors, and (for zoonotic diseases) intermediate-host ecology; and
3	Tertiary: More diffuse effects (eg, mental health problems in failing farm communities, displaced groups, disadvantaged indigenous and minority ethnic groups); consequences of tension and conflict owing to climate changerelated declines in basic resources (water, food, timber, living space)
With regard to primary risks, climate change directly impacts the populations in all geographical areas that KP serves While all regions in which KP operates are at risk of illnesses and loss of life due to extreme temperatures, the specific risk exposures may vary For example, while the Northern and Southern California regions are particularly affected by droughts, wildfires and heat waves, the Mid-Atlantic States and Georgia are more prone to severe storms and storm surges Hawaii and the Pacific Northwest are relatively more exposed to coastal flooding as well as heat waves In general, global warming can aggravate the effects of pre-existing health conditions such as chronic respiratory disease and asthma, due to increases in air pollutants and aeroallergens There is evidence of declining air quality in cities since greater heat can also worsen air pollution such as ground-level ozone or smog According to the National Center for Health Statistics, overall current asthma prevalence among adults increased from 20012002 (71%) to 20132014 (92%) By weight status, prevalence increased among overweight adults but not among adults in the obese or normal weight categories 
With regard to secondary risks, climate-related disturbances in ecological systems, such as changes in the range of infective parasites, can increase the incidence of serious infectious diseases The tick that carries Lyme Disease is reported in 457% of US counties, up from 30% in 1998  Other secondary health effects of global warming include water- and food-borne diseases Warm temperatures also increase water pollution which harms human health In rural areas, increased food insecurity can occur due to geographical shifts in optimum growing conditions and decreases in crop yields; reduced water resources for agriculture and for human consumption; and loss of property such as cropland because of floods, droughts and a rise in sea level
With regard to tertiary risks, according to The Medical Society Consortium on Climate and Health: Many people exposed to the worst extreme weather events experience stress and serious mental health consequences including depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and increases in suicidal thoughts and behavior Such disasters are also associated with increases in alcohol or drug abuse Children may also experience prolonged separation from their parents Beyond the well-known risks specific disasters pose to our mental health, the physical, social, and economic stresses created by climate change all increase our risk of mental health problems

Foremost Property and Casualty Insurance Company,"  As an organization, Farmers recognizes that it is essential that we consider the impact we have on the environment, and that we create and foster a culture where all individuals are aware of opportunities to conserve energy and natural resources

We have initiatives in process that reduce our carbon footprint  These include changes in the way we manage our facilities, our fleet, and our travel 

Our goal is to purchase energy in an efficient, cost effective and environmentally responsible manner, and to establish and implement effective energy management programs

We have installed a new Cool Roof product at one of our facilities and have installed solar panels in two other locations  We continue to implement electrical power conservation programs in multiple operations  In some locations we have installed motion sensitive light switches and energy saving light bulbs (such as ALTO lights from Phillips, which are recognized by the industry as energy-efficient lighting solutions), and have replaced existing parking lot lighting fixtures with more energy efficient LED light fixtures  In Austin, TX we are presently converting our 190,000 sq ft office and also our 9,000 sq ft office in McAllen, TX over to 100% green electricity through electricity provider contracts  In Grand Rapids, MI we have replaced (4) 25+ year old elevators with more energy efficient elevators which are projected to save $5,000 annually in electricity costs  In Wilmington, DE, we are in the process of converting all office light fixtures from standard fluorescent lighting to energy efficient LED lights; projecting a $700,000 savings over the next 10 years  In addition to these improvements, we have also implemented programs to remind employees to power down equipment when it is not in use  Many computer monitors and desktop computers are automatically set to go into a sleep or hibernation mode after a short period of inactivity

Depending on job assignment, employees may be provided with a company fleet vehicle  Since  2010, more fuel efficient, 4 cylinder vehicles have been selected for our general lines vehicles and the number of unassigned and pool vehicles at our various office locations has been reduced  Miles driven in 2013 were 34% lower than miles driven in 2010  A 42% reduction in the total tons of CO2 over this four year time period has been attained due to fewer vehicles in service, fewer miles driven and the decision to down-size from full-size to mid-size and compact vehicles 

As many Farmers employees commute to our business locations, we encourage ridesharing and the use of public transportation  In some locations, we provide incentives including subsidies for train passes, bus passes and vanpools, free shuttle buses from train stations, and preferred carpool parking spaces  

Telepresence technology and high quality HD video conferencing systems in many operations have helped minimize airline travel   

In addition to our focus on the reduction of emissions we have made improvements in our effort to reduce water consumption  Improvements include low volume sink faucets, low volume toilets, and waterless urinals  Other improvements within our operations include upgrades to programmable irrigation systems and pop-up sprinkler heads, which eliminate leakage and overspray

We continue to work on reducing utilization of paper and office supplies   Copier/printer machines in many of our locations are set for duplex (two-sided) printing and the print/copy default has been set to black and white vs color  Virtually all employee communications are handled electronically rather than through paper  As of 2011, semi-monthly statements of employee earnings and deductions have been electronically available and are no longer printed and mailed to employees  Improved ordering processes have lowered the volume of consumable supplies in many locations  Recycling programs have been implemented for paper, plastic, cardboard and glass  Printer, copier ink and toner cartridges are also recycled, as are cell phones, chargers and obsolete electronic equipment such as computers and monitors  In our mail rooms, we have begun recycling and reusing packing materials for shipping   

We have implemented initiatives that provide customers with environmentally friendly choices that also reduce the organizations carbon footprint 
 
For example, in some operations, mail sent to agents and customers is delivered in envelopes made of recycled material  A new billing system available in some states and for some products provides increased on-line billing and payment capabilities  In some states and for some products, we are working to provide customers with the option to receive electronic policy forms and notices from us, rather than paper copies  Customers with these electronic policies may also have the option to receive bills, pay bills, and view their billing histories online  Some states prohibit the use of paperless communication with policyholders, which limits our ability to consider paperless options 

Our MultiCar auto policy, available in some states, can cover multiple vehicles on one policy, thereby reducing the amount of paper customers receive and our overall carbon footprint

In 2010, Farmers built a 164,000 SF facility in Oklahoma City that was recognized by the US Green Building Council as qualifying for Core and Shell LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) certification at the silver level, and also qualified for LEED certification for the Tenant Improvement portion of the project  1400 employees moved into the building in October 2010 and continue to work there today  

In some of our larger facilities: 1) ice and water machines are provided, reducing plastic bottled water consumption; 2) programmable thermostats are in place; 3) carbon footprint studies and energy audits have been completed; 4) Energy Star equipment is purchased whenever practical; 5) cleaning hours were revised to allow for more daytime cleaning, allowing us to deactivate interior lights earlier in the evening; 6) new employees are informed of our green business practices during their initial training classes and existing employees receive regular electronic communications on various energy-related topics, keeping awareness at a high level

In addition the two Print and Distribution Centers in North America have implemented several significant initiatives to mitigate impacts to the environment including: aggressive approach to deliver agent, customer and broker documents electronically versus traditional USPS mail;  operationally printing of customer transactional documents on lighter weight paper (transitioning from 20# to 18# or 16#); changing the operation from chemical-based inks to soy/water-based inks; Print-On-Demand of agent support materials versus warehoused stored materials; digitizing as much in-bound mail as possible via an active imaging approach; implemented many initiatives improving efficiency, lowering energy consumption, active operational recycling program, consolidating operations to a  two-site COE model and reducing operational waste from 4% to less than 2%",0

Metropolitan Casualty Insurance Company,"  MetLife addresses climate change and implements environmental sustainability initiatives as part of its overall business strategy  Through MetLifes Sustainability Program, the Company strives to lower energy consumption, mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and reduce the overall environmental impact of its global operations  

MetLifes GHG emissions reduction strategy focuses on energy efficiency and green energy purchasing for US owned-and-operated facilities while the Company has achieved emissions reductions in other areas of its carbon footprint as well In 2005, MetLife set a goal to reduce its indirect GHG emissions (Scope 2 emissions) by 20 percent by 2010 (based on the 2005 baseline year) for all its US owned-and-operated office facilities This goal was achieved in 2009 and, to-date, the portfolio has reduced Scope 2 emissions by 100 percent, while simultaneously reducing energy consumption by 24 percent The energy reduction was realized through capital projects and facility upgrades focused on energy savings, water efficiency, and demand metering   Although we have already made significant progress, MetLife continues to look for new opportunities to reduce its carbon footprint, to address climate change and to invest in efforts that will have a positive impact on the environment  Today, two new emissions reduction targets have been set for the Companys US owner occupied office portfolio  The first is a 5 percent reduction in energy (kWh) consumption by 2015 relative to a 2010 baseline year The second is an annual 100 percent emissions reduction for the portfolio's Scope 2 GHG emissions, to be achieved through the Companys green energy purchasing strategies 

MetLife also embeds environmental sustainability and emissions reduction programs into its overall business strategy through green procurement practices and environmental certifications (ex Energy Star, LEED, etc) at its global office facilities  Recent initiatives include MetLifes participation in the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) Supply Chain Program, an initiative aimed at benchmarking and reducing value chain emissions  Another example is the Companys focus on improving the energy efficiency and reducing the environmental impact of its data center operations  In 2012, MetLifes data center at the Rensselaer Information Systems Center (RISC) in Troy, New York, became the first Energy Star-certified data center in New York State In 2013, the data center scored in the 98th percentile of existing building data centers Currently, there are less than 40 data centers with the Energy Star label and MetLifes has one of the highest rankings in the nation  The projects we implemented to reduce RISCs environmental impacts included: installing boiler system controls; upgrading lighting control panels; using waterless technology; and implementing virtualization technology, which allows the facility to share resources and save costs in energy, hardware, software licensing, and IT infrastructure maintenance

NATIONWIDE PROP & CAS INS CO," A robust Enterprise Risk Management program identifies potential risks and develops controls to systematically assess the impact of these risks to its business

As part of the detailed risk assessment, Nationwides Enterprise Risk Management team works in collaboration with the business leaders across the multiple businesses to understand the risk that climate change poses over the strategic horizon This process involves identifying exposure for incremental risk and reward as well as assessing the companys capabilities against industry practices Risks associated with climate change as identified through Nationwides risk assessment process are discussed in the response to question four above

In order to measure the risks from certain natural perils potentially associated with climate change, Nationwide licenses the software and support of external catastrophe modeling vendors These vendors constantly review and update their models to incorporate the most recent science available 

These models allow Nationwide to measure their catastrophe exposure and develop a perspective on the potential size and likelihood of various catastrophes These models also allow the Nationwide companies to assess how various strategies will impact this risk including changes to deductibles, changes to market shares and geographic diversification

Specific to the hurricane peril, the major catastrophe modeling vendors have developed alternative event scenario catalogs associated with increased sea surface temperatures which some scientists might attribute to global warming Elevated sea surface temperatures are important because hurricanes are fueled by the warmth of the ocean These alternative event catalogs, therefore, represent a climate-conditioned view of risk This alternate view is used to assess the sensitivity of insured risk to elevated sea surface temperatures 

Beyond the direct output from the models, measurement and sensitivity analysis can be informed by maintaining external partnerships in academia, trade associations, experts from the modeling vendors, and reinsurers and brokers Nationwide has developed these types of external relationships and regularly avails itself of information from these sources as an integral part of the risk management program

Gateway Health Plan Inc.,"  To date, we have not identified any climate change related risks that would have significant, near-term financial implications 

The Company also has a team of analysts that identify medical trends and can recommend actions to take to get ahead of, and react to, these trends This is important, as the longer summers have brought with them an increase in health risks Warmer temperatures increase pollen production and ground ozone formation, which exacerbates asthma, allergies, and other respiratory conditions Also, the change in climate favors the survival of insects and disease carriers, such as mosquitoes and ticks that may increase West Nile virus and Lyme disease diagnoses

"Cigna Health and Life Insurance Company, Inc."," Climate change is one risk that would be considered
Cignas general account investment portfolio consists predominately of fixed-income assets While the primary risks Cigna undertakes are credit related, climate change can play a role in our evaluation of the creditworthiness of specific issuers and industries Risk factors may include:
	Changes in regulatory requirements (eg, emissions controls);
	Changes in supply/demand for fuel (eg, oil, natural gas);
	Developments in renewable energy sources; and
	Effects of extreme weather events on industries and issuers
Climate change may impact certain investments For example, commercial real estate may become less desirable due to climate change factors such as global warming, rising sea levels or hurricane activity This could adversely affect a property's value as collateral for a commercial mortgage loan Climate changes can influence the inflation outlook and/or creditworthiness of specific emerging market issuers (eg a reduction in rainfall can cause food prices to rise, increasing inflation)",4

KAISER FOUNDATION HLTH PLAN OF WA," The ERM program is governed by executive management and the Board of Directors The program has a strategic and multi-year (three-year) lens It deals with risks and opportunities that can affect value creation and preservation over time, and provides a holistic view of risks, including external, operational, and strategic Climate change is included as a key aspect of the ""trends impacting health"" risk
With regard to managing health risks correlated with climate change, KP is uniquely positioned to 1) have early indications regarding weather/climate-related conditions through its research programs, and 2) provide timely and responsive care to members through its integrated care delivery system In terms of facility risks, KP has a robust business continuity program that ensures continued operations in the event of natural or manmade disasters
KPs executive leadership has adopted an organizational guideline related to climate change, excerpted below:
If greenhouse gas emissions continue to increase, climate change will cause health effects that will directly impact KPs ability to fulfill our promise of quality affordable care Global climate instability will increase the demand for health care The costs of energy and water are likely to increase while supplies are diminished Threats to biodiversity could also threaten the availability of potential cures for diseases KP adopts the following principles:
1	Understand climate change
2	Assess and avoid climate-related impacts
3	Commit to continuous improvement
4	Support industry standards
5	Inform public policies
As noted in KPs response to question 1, KP has a goal to become carbon neutral in 2020, and one way that KP reduces its avoidable emissions is through large-scale investments in clean and renewable energy sources An added benefit of these investments is that, by providing KP with a long-term fixed price for electricity, they provide KP with an important hedge against potentially significant swings in energy prices resulting from climate impacts and/or climate policies
3 Describe your company's process for identifying climate change-related risks and assessing the degree that they could affect your business, including financial implications
The company has a process for identifying climate change-related risks and assessing the degree that it could affect its business including financial implications as noted below
KP carefully monitors studies and reports issued by government agencies and other organizations that speak to climate change-related risks and uses these reports and findings to assess impact on KPs business
One way that KP may be able to regularly reassess climate change related risks over time is through health research carried out by the organization In 2005, Kaiser Permanente launched a program aimed at building one of the largest and most comprehensive resources in the United States for research on the influence of both inherited and environmental factors on peoples health The databank created through this program, now called the Kaiser Permanente Research Bank, has the ambitious goal of recruiting 500,000 Kaiser Permanente adult members to share health information and a small blood sample for research The Research Bank is conducting scientific studies that are examining the role of genes and environment in conditions as varied as diabetes, cancer, bipolar disorder, heart disease, asthma, glaucoma, multiple sclerosis, and migraine  among many others DNA samples are used to produce genotypic markers on the whole genomes of Research Bank participants, making it possible to study the role of genes in many different diseases and conditions KP investigators and collaborating scientists can conduct research to understand genetic and environmental influences  including weather and climate influences  on disease susceptibility, the course of disease, and response to treatment; as well as to translate these findings into improvements in medical care and public health By studying data pulled from Kaiser Permanente Research Bank participants' health surveys, electronic health records and DNA samples, researchers are now looking for new ways to diagnose, treat and prevent certain diseases

Applied Underwriters Captive Risk Assurance Company Inc,"  The Group includes several large subgroups of companies as well as a number of smaller subgroups and companies that operate independently While some of the larger subgroups own their own buildings and can thus have maximum control of their physical operations, many of the companies lease or rent the properties in which they operate, and therefore have less control of the physical aspects of their operations

Recycling of paper, glass and plastic are encouraged in all operations Reductions in energy usage are effected through the use of technology by encouraging electronic communication verses paper usage whenever available Imaging technology is used to replace paper usage and long term information storage Updating computer equipment regularly allows the Group to take advantage of newer technology, often reducing energy usage as well as adding more computing power while using less equipment Intelligent usage of energy is encouraged in all operations as a cost control issue as well as the positive impact that has for reducing the operational energy footprints

The two largest operational subgroups are General Reinsurance and GEICO  General Reinsurance has recently relocated its corporate headquarters in Stamford, CT, moving from an energy inefficient office environment, to an open floor design (no associates have offices, from the CEO on down) and specialized glass exterior that are energy efficient and result in cost savings to the company   

GEICO has the largest number of employees and physical operations among the Berkshire Hathaway group of insurance companies The following is GEICOs summary of their response to this question It serves as a model for its affiliates

GEICO is making significant strides in its Green initiatives, which includes measures to limit its greenhouse gas emissions The company has established green teams to focus on the issues and establish improvements The company encourages its associates to carpool, bike, or use public transportation, and it provides certain benefits to reduce the cost for its employees to use public transportation The company has increased its use of teleconferencing to reduce travel 

Here are several examples of changes implemented as a result of the green team efforts:

In GEICOs corporate headquarters it has eliminated all small departmental pantries and combined them into centralized pantries located strategically throughout the 600Ksf facility using strictly Energy Star approved appliances  More than 300 toasters were eliminated as well as toaster ovens, microwaves, portable and large refrigerators  The drastic reduction of appliances within the facility resulted in significant annual energy usage savings 

In a $2M+ project implemented in one of its regions, GEICO converted parking lot lighting from 400w metal halide to 255w LED  This region also switched from 32w T8 lamps to 25w T8 lamps on the production floors  100w metal halide lamps have been replaced by 20w LED in the stairwells

In an effort to reduce lighting to no more than the industry lighting levels GEICO removed lamps from 2x4 parabolic and other type of multi-lamp light fixtures where appropriate to conserve energy 

Many GEICO departments have implemented 2 sided printing versus printing on a single side of paper

One regional office installed a paper shredder in the vicinity of their loading dock to do its own shredding and bailing of paper

One regional office has solicited an energy consultant and the review and resulting changes implemented has resulted in significant electricity and natural gas usage savings 

GEICO has continued to increase the number of four cylinder vehicles in its Corporate Fleet  Furthermore, the average number of gallons of gasoline purchased has been reduced and as a result the CO2 emissions have been reduced The company is exploring the use of diesel and hybrid vehicles to further reduce emissions The company is also increasing the use of van pools for employees

The use of non-volatile organic ingredients paint is preferred wherever possible within its facilities

GEICO has implemented water saving measures at its corporate headquarters by remodeling restrooms with water saving faucets, 16 gal flush toilets and 125 gal flush urinals  The faucets have preset temperature controls as well  Green biodegradable restroom paper products are being used in some offices

GEICO also promotes the use of technology to its customer base to reduce the amount of paper mail it sends It encourages its customers to transact business and receive information from the company via email and the internet, which reduces the paper footprint impact on the environment

The core of GEICOs green efforts are the establishment of both a Recycling Program and an Energy Report Card Furthermore, GEICO has made strides in reducing the impact that its Fleet has on the environment The Recycling Program is aimed at reducing the waste generation at all GEICO facilities, including proper disposal of all recyclable materials such as paper, aluminum cans and plastic bottles, ink toner cartridges, electronic waste, fluorescent bulbs, construction waste and rechargeable batteries GEICO further reduces its paper usage by double sided printing on all photocopiers and network printers

There are hundreds of office supply products that are made from recycled materials that GEICO procures and stocks for the entire company from a national supplier The frequency by which recycled material office supplies is used depends on the product being ordered

The Energy Report Card is aimed at administering best practices at all GEICO facilities to reduce energy consumption In its continuing efforts to conserve energy, GEICO  has implemented the following changes in its corporate headquarters during the past year:

1)	Replaced two (2) 50+ year old centrifugal chillers with brand new centrifugal chillers  
2)	Replaced two (2) 50+ year old boilers with brand new boilers
3)	Replaced all 3M window film throughout the entire facility with 486,000 useable sf
4)	Replaced all mushroom parking lot lights with LED mushroom lights  This was in excess of 200 fixtures

Previous activities related to energy usage reduction relate to:

The use of a heat exchanger that takes advantage of free cooling in temperatures of 55 degrees Fahrenheit or less during the year

Installation of contemporary 2 megawatt emergency backup power generators equipped with the most advanced low NOX emissions equipment

Reduced demand for cooling power in data centers by both alternating the operation of redundant AC units and proactively sealing cable cutout holes that can save appreciably on the energy consumed for data center equipment asset cooling  A further measure to reduce energy consumption was to raise thermostat set points such that AC units runs less often while at the same time providing suitable cooling for the intended space

Installation of lighting controllers which permit powering down entire floors of facilities lighting during non-business hours

	Removing excess light bulbs in workspaces based upon National Illumination Society lighting standards

Replacing CRT computer monitors with flat screen monitor technology

Personal computers themselves are set to shut themselves off after a period of non-use (at night)

Copiers and printers are programmed to take advantage of sleep-mode inherent to the device when not in use

Deployment of new energy-wise vending machines

The following projects are in progress:

1)	Replaced the 20+ year old Building Automated System (BAS) that controls all HVAC throughout the facility  This Phase 1 projects to cut all main constant running AHU over to VFD technology to permit ramping up to the building HVAC load versus running continuously at full speed is 60% complete 
2)	Install window shades to compliment the window films ability to reject heat from the sun further reducing our cooling load on the building  This project will be completed in November

American Fire & Casualty Insurance Company,"  This would result in an increase in both the magnitude and volatility of losses due to severe weather events  Ensuring adequate pricing for natural catastrophe risks would become more challenging, particularly given the existing regulatory regime

Severe weather related events of concern, such as hurricanes and severe thunderstorm/tornados, are localized, short-term weather related events that are a second order impact of a warming global climate  While it is logical to assume that a warmer climate would increase the amount of atmospheric energy available for the formation of localized, short-term severe weather events, the precise impact to the frequency and severity of such events relative to historical levels is uncertain  

Increases in property catastrophe risk associated with climate change will manifest themselves gradually over a period of many years (decades), while policies are of one-year duration  This allows Liberty Mutual the opportunity to adjust rates, coverages and underwriting guidelines as required in response to trends that demonstrate an increase in the frequency and/or severity of natural catastrophe events  The Company will continue to closely monitor trends in catastrophe loss frequency and severity, and to employ the latest generation of computer modeling tools to estimate exposures to natural catastrophe events, adjust pricing and underwriting guidelines as necessary  

Future pricing must be sufficiently flexible and continuously incorporate the latest trend data and scientific advances in catastrophe modeling to ensure adequate risk adjusted returns on capital  A significant concern is the potential for a wide divergence in the future between the consensus view of natural catastrophe risk between insurers and the regulators with authority to approve changes to pricing  Many current regulatory regimes do not allow sufficient flexibility to ensure that pricing is set at actuarially sound levels, and in effect set price controls that are slow to react to changes in risk levels  Should the Company be unable to raise rates consistent with any increases natural catastrophe risk, the only viable strategic option may be to significantly restrict the amount of business written in certain markets, or possibly to exit certain markets altogether

The geographical areas impacted by climate change risk are generally those that are currently at the greatest risk for the natural catastrophe perils described above (eg, the East Coast and Gulf for hurricane, and the Central and Southern US for tornado/severe thunderstorm)  Any increase in the frequency and severity of natural catastrophes may expand the boundaries of the geographic areas that are susceptible to each peril, but the areas indicated above are likely to continue to be of highest risk

Progressive Northwestern Insurance Company,"  We are implementing the latest developments in fresh-water flood modeling that provide a better understanding of this vulnerability than existing data such as FEMA Flood Zones  This will also be combined with our hurricane models, as fresh-water flooding is often the leading cause of hurricane losses (along with wind and storm surge) We also use government and academic forecasts as input to our hurricane loss models along with vendor-supplied loss models for Homeowners lines  For other risks, we incorporate historical data and insights from experts  The models separate the cause (the storm or weather event) from the loss function so that changes in the storm characteristics (frequency, intensity, size, duration and correlation with other weather risks) are correctly reflected in our aggregate loss estimates  We generate separate and independent results/exposures for auto vs property type risks",7

SWISS RE LIFE & HEALTH AMERICA INC.," The greatest insured loss potentials come from tropical cyclones, tornado, hail, winter storms, and floods Other risks include snow storms, ice storms, wild fire, and drought These physical impacts of climate change mainly pose a risk to our property insurance and reinsurance business Although the risks are global, the greatest potential impacts come from areas which are both highly exposed and have a high insurance penetration rate These include the Gulf and East coasts of the United States for the US entities (and non-US entities that write US business) in the Group2

Through international affiliates, Swiss Re is also exposed to coastal and inland areas of
European states (including, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, the Netherlands and the
UK) and Japan There is already a high level of climate risk in many regions This will
increase unless appropriate greenhouse gas emissions reductions are made and climate
resilience measures implemented The potential impacts of climate change on human
health are likely to be less visible in the short-term In the US, Westport Insurance
Corporation writes employer stop loss and HMO reinsurance Potential insured losses are
most likely in industrialized countries due to the high levels of insurance penetration The greatest exposure to climate related impacts on life and health tend to be in developing countries which have far smaller insurance markets Currently, we do not consider the risk of potential climate related losses to our life and health operations to be as high as the risk facing our property business

It is difficult to predict the future and determine how much of an influence climate change may have on any atmospheric caused risk We can make certain estimates as to where the risk may increase (eg coastal communities from sea level rise) due to climate change over the next century but, for example, we do not know how well as a society we will adapt to these changes in risk going forward through better zoning, building practices etc Exclusive of climate change the costs associated with atmospheric related events are increasing due to changes in wealth, construction costs, and our desire to live in coastal and other exposed areas Our business relies on understanding and anticipating to the extent possible all risks; current, future, actual, and possible Losses relating to natural catastrophes are growing and changes in climate will lead to more physical losses in other sectors including agriculture and tourism as well as coastal areas, woodlands and in locations prone to flash flooding We can use our tools and technology to estimate this impact based on current scientific projections

Risks, including climate risks, which could threaten our ability to function as a company
across the various locations from which we operate are assessed by our Safety, Security,
and Business Continuity Management unit Swiss Re operates a comprehensive group-wide
Operational Risk and Business Continuity Management system Each location has a local
Safety and Security Officer, Business Continuity Manager, and an Incident
Management/Business Continuity Team in place All reasonable measures are taken to
ensure operational effectiveness even in critical and emergency situations We do not
consider climate risk to be a major threat to the operational effectiveness of Swiss Re
locations Regardless, the potential for climate change to increase losses led to the
development of Swiss Re's climate change strategy and provided the impetus for increased
investment in climate risk research, awareness building, advocacy and reducing the
company's own carbon footprint

Legislative or regulatory actions taken by Federal and State governments in response to
climate change may pose new risks but also opportunities for a company like Swiss Re
Regulation, in the US or on the international level, leading to an agreement on how to
manage a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions will spur the development of renewable
energy projects, and may lead to increased demand for insurance products offered by our
company As an example, Swiss Re offers customized products such as stream flow and
precipitation hedges to hydroelectric producers to compensate for additional costs
associated with electricity production lost due to reduced water flows Swiss Re could also benefit from the increased demand for other products, such as conventional re/insurance policies to cover construction and operational risks associated with the development of solar power For example, Swiss Re provides reinsurance cover to the Desert Sunlight Solar project in Riverside County, California This is a 550 MW facility currently under construction and will eventually provide enough power to run 165,000 homes

The Hanover American Insurance Company," (The Hanover) recognizes the risks that climate change poses to our environment and is committed to a multiyear strategy to assess, reduce, and mitigate its energy use, carbon footprint and emissions  

Energy efficiency has always been an important area of focus for The Hanover More than 25 years ago, The Hanover began a journey to reduce its carbon footprint From an early investment in ultra-efficient ice harvesting thermal storage technology to cool one of its buildings, to upgrading fan systems with high efficiency variable speed drive motors, installing continuous commissioning energy management systems, upgrading  much of its lighting to efficient LED fixtures, the installation of white roofs on many buildings and the completion of a multi-million dollar project to replace over 300 windows with high efficiency, energy saving low-e double pane windows at its headquarters facility, The Hanover has worked tirelessly to reduce its energy consumption The culmination of these and many other energy conservation projects have resulted in the achievement of the prestigious EPA Energy Star certification for eleven of the past twelve years for The Hanovers owned properties This certification affirms top quartile performance in energy usage according to EPA guidelines 

The Hanover has also established a leadership position in the area of environmental responsibility For the past eleven consecutive years, 100% of the electricity consumed at the 800K square foot headquarters campus is offset by certified Renewable Wind Energy Certificates In addition, for over a decade, The Hanover has worked diligently to improve and strengthen its Green Cleaning program This program improves indoor air quality, reduces water consumption and energy usage, and utilizes cleaning products that have minimal impact to the waste stream The Hanover also takes pride in its innovative and robust recycling and compost programs which year after year effectively diverts close to 40% of the total waste stream at its headquarters facility away from landfills  

The Hanover recognizes the impact its employees have on the environment as they commute to and from work With this in mind, The Hanover has long supported the use of alternate forms of travel to reduce Greenhouse Gas emissions With the recognition that electric cars materially contribute to the reduction of carbon emissions and a healthier planet, we have invested in electric car charging stations for employees and visitors at our headquarters facility With Massachusetts mandating that all new cars sold in the state be electric vehicles by 2035, we are proud to help pave the way for widespread adoption   For many years The Hanover has supported employee flexible work arrangements, and recently introduced Hanover Hybrid Flex, a remote work program allowing most employees to work from home 2-3 days per week, further improving air quality and reducing traffic on our congested roadways 

Beyond the measurable results above, each year The Hanover encourages active hands on employee participation by hosting an Employee Earth Day Celebration, to educate and showcase The Hanovers energy efficiency and environmental conservation projects This much-anticipated event includes interactive exhibits, booths and presentations by internal groups, vendors and other stakeholders that invest their time and energy to make ours a more energy efficient, green-friendly planet Employees are encouraged to ask questions, learn and become active participants in reducing their carbon footprint not only at work, but in their homes and communities as well 

All of these efforts have a significant impact on our organization Most importantly, our sustainability efforts and programs make a meaningful impact in reducing The Hanovers carbon footprint Over the years, we have witnessed a significant reduction in energy consumption and experienced material cost savings as a result of our efforts Finally, as we continue to strive to recruit the best talent in the industry, our sustainability practices have helped us attract more environmentally conscious employees, especially early-in-career talent, who view sustainability as a baseline requirement for their employer, and will continuously challenge The Hanover to deliver even more going forward

LM General Insurance Company," The Company is a member of the Institute of International Finance and a sponsor of the Wharton Risk Management and Decisions Processes Center at the University of Pennsylvania, both of which are engaged in ongoing initiatives and research to assess the potential impacts of climate change on the insurance industry and its customers and to develop or support appropriate strategies that enable the industry to address and communicate these impacts 

Liberty Mutual is a member of the Insurance Institute for Business & Home Safety (IBHS) The following text, prepared by IBHS, is a brief description of the Institute and some of its activities that relate to the issue of climate change

IBHS is a 501(c)(3) organization, wholly supported by the property (re)insurance industry, which conducts objective, scientific research to identify and promote effective actions that strengthen homes, businesses, and communities against natural disasters and other causes of loss IBHS does this by identifying and advocating improved property design, construction, retrofitting, maintenance, repair, and preparation practices IBHS guidance for mitigating property losses is available directly to the public and to our members/policyholders, at wwwdisastersafetyorg, and through social media (eg, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, YouTube, and Vimeo)

IBHS advocates the concept of going green and building strong recognizing that addressing climate change involves both reducing greenhouse gas emissions and adapting homes, businesses, and communities to severe weather that may result from climate change:
	As an insurance-supported organization, IBHS recognizes that climate change strategies must do more than build structures to be energy efficient They must be built to modern fire protection standards to help resist fire and avoid the water/chemical deluge needed for fire suppression; they should be strong enough to avoid wind destruction and resulting relocation in landfills; and properties should be sited and elevated in a manner that protects against flooding and environmental degradation from landslides All of these are part of going green
	IBHS also firmly believes that adaptation is critical, not only to reduce long-term property insurance losses, but to buttress individual and societal resilience All of the property protection measures that IBHS advocates to strengthen structures against current weather threats will also reduce future losses caused by climate change events And, the unprecedented scientific research conducted at the unique IBHS Research Center is critical to identification of new mitigation actions that may help protect against more severe weather events
	Additionally, research conducted by IBHS will help to make sure that green building enhancements do not inadvertently cause structures to be less disaster-resistant, or even worse, threaten the life safety of occupants or first responders For example, photovoltaic arrays that take flight or pose fire suppression challenges are the antithesis of building strong 

Liberty Mutual engages its policyholders in several ways to address climate change The Company offers discounts to policyholders that have taken specific steps to reduce their susceptibility to extreme weather events through structural modifications to their properties Policyholders are incentivized to reduce their CO2 emissions through products that cover structural modifications such as installed solar panels with full replacement guarantees, and discounts for hybrid vehicles Other products and endorsements allow for replacement of existing mechanical equipment and appliances with upgraded high efficiency units in the event of a loss The Company also has Loss Prevention units staffed by engineers and other technical experts who consult directly with commercial property owners and develop detailed plans for actions that can be taken to reduce the susceptibility of losses due to severe weather events

o	Take active steps to ensure that Avivas approach to CR, climate change and the environment is clearly understood by employees and clearly communicated to our stakeholders
o	Adhere to local, national, and/or regional legislation that may exceed the control objectives set in this standard

GreaterNew york Mutual Insurance Company," Assessing catastrophic risk is a core component of our underwriting process  We are not purely a writer of catastrophic risk, but because we insure property-related risks, catastrophic risk is an inherent component of our operations Our reinsurance broker uses two different models to forecast our catastrophe risk under various scenarios  Although there is not an explicit forecast for risks associated with climate change, such factors are considered indirectly as the models utilize past events to assist with forecasting the potential impact of future events We utilize the results of such models, and also our extensive knowledge of the risks we underwrite, to ensure that we purchase sufficient reinsurance to limit our net loss if a major catastrophic event were to occur  This ensures that in the event of a major catastrophe we have sufficient liquidity to meet requests for payments from our policyholders who have incurred covered losses as a result of catastrophic events Because of the potential material impact of such events, we assess them on a regular basis, and will ensure that formal modeling exercises are done at least annually This way we take advantage of the models as they continue to evolve and reflect additional historical loss data, some of which is likely related to climate change",2

If climate Change refers to anything other than Weather Catastrophe Loss Management then our answer is no as predictions of catastrophic climate change are the subject of debate, and its existence and effect are, if any, both long term and uncertain Given that our insurance policies terms are no more than 12 months, we have lots of time to act if there is actual, material climate change, and its effects become known No state will approve rate increases based on uncertain predictions of unknown loss, and no customer will pay for it Therefore, we believe that making policy and decisions on such uncertainty is both impractical and a waste of policyholder resources

A sampling of projects implemented to date include installation of more efficient light fixtures, reductions in the hours lights are used, operation of sophisticated lighting controls which include daylight harvesting features and occupancy sensors, paperless solutions (eBill, ePayments, and ePolicy), real estate consolidation, improvement in fuel economy of the corporate fleet, and building material recycling In total, Allstate estimates these activities resulted in nearly 21,000 MT of CO2 emissions reductions
in 2012 (Scope 1, 2, & 3)

Projects planned for 2013 and beyond include electric vehicle charging stations at corporate office campus in Northbrook, IL To reduce the
energy associated with data storage and other computing-intensive processes, Allstate has begun increasing the temperature at owned data centers, thereby reducing the overall cooling load at these facilities

Alfa Mutual Insurance Company," Currently, the increase in frequency and severity in Alfas results is not dissimilar to results we are seeing on a global basis In addition, we upgrade to the current catastrophe models as they are updated, typically this is annually The result of these upgrades, in recent years, has been to model significantly higher probable maximum losses relative to the underlying changes in exposure Additionally, we utilize internal modeling activities to adjust national models to be more reflective of regional experience within our property books  Lastly, we apply a DFA model to 200,000 separate simulations of potential risk scenarios to understand impacts on operating performance and surplus

The increase in frequency and severity can, and is, having a significant impact on operating results in our property book The increase in property losses is putting significant upward pressure on pricing Because the industry is experiencing similar results, competitors are seeing similar pressure on pricing In addition, the higher loss ratios created from storm related events is having a negative effect on operating performance entity-wide",2
Main Street America Assurance Company,"   As such, responses are being provided at an enterprise level

The American Family Insurance Group encourages policyholders to prevent or mitigate losses caused by covered perils, whether or not the losses can be attributed to climate change  This includes providing customers with informational newsletters and brochures related to loss reduction  For example, the Main Street America Insurance companies provide brochures that outline hurricane preparedness tips and plans  We also offer discounts in many states for customers that have hurricane or wind mitigation devices Flood coverage is available through our agents via the National Flood Insurance Program 
Furthermore, American Family Insurance is a member of the Insurance Institute for Business and Home Safety (IBHS)  The following text, prepared by IBHS, is a brief description of the Institute and some of its activities that relate to the issue of climate change

IBHS is a 501(c)(3) organization, wholly supported by the property (re)insurance industry, which conducts objective, scientific research to identify and promote effective actions that strengthen homes, businesses and communities against natural disasters and other causes of loss IBHS does this by identifying and advocating improved property design, construction, retrofitting, maintenance, repair and preparation practices  IBHS guidance for mitigating property losses is available directly to the public and to our members/policyholders, at wwwdisastersafetyorg, and through social media (eg, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, YouTube and Vimeo)
IBHS advocates the concept of going green and building strong recognizing that addressing climate change involves reducing greenhouse gas emissions and adapting homes, businesses, and communities to severe weather that may result from climate change:
	As an insurance-supported organization, IBHS recognizes that climate change strategies must do more than build structures to be energy efficient  They must be built to modern fire protection standards to help resist fire and avoid the water/chemical deluge needed for fire suppression; they should be strong enough to avoid wind destruction and resulting relocation in landfills; and properties should be sited and elevated in a manner that protects against flooding and environmental degradation from landslides  All of these are part of going green
	IBHS also firmly believes that adaptation is critical, not only to reduce long-term property insurance losses, but to buttress individual and societal resilience  All of the property protection measures that IBHS advocates to strengthen structures against current weather threats will also reduce future losses caused by climate change events  And, the unprecedented scientific research conducted at the unique IBHS Research Center is critical to identification of new mitigation actions that may help protect against more severe weather events
	Additionally, research conducted by IBHS will help to make sure that green building enhancements do not inadvertently cause structures to be less disaster-resistant, or even worse, threaten the life safety of occupants or first respondersfor example, photovoltaic arrays that take flight or pose fire suppression challenges are the antithesis of building strong  

In 2014, American Family Insurance partnered with IBHS through a first-of-its-kind national study that will support IBHS researchers over the next 25 years in identifying the effects of aging on residential roofing materials, with the ultimate goal of making residential roofs last longer and leak less ultimately helping customers mitigate risks The study will determine how Midwest weather affects different brands of roofing material, using a dozen scientifically instrumented roof structures built on a bare patch of ground at American Family Insurances corporate headquarters This is a part of a larger study driven by IBHS and other participating member companies

Liberty Mutual Insurance Company," 
1	We are committed to transitioning to a low-carbon economy and will established long-term (10 to 30 years) emissions reduction targets that informs our transition strategy  The targets serve as a north star for teams and businesses who are actively building customized carbon reduction roadmaps  
2	We will establish short-term (one-to-three year) emission reduction targets that are aligned to and provide an actionable pathway to achieve our long-term emission reduction target; these targets allow us to measure and demonstrate progress over time 
3	We believe that carbon emissions from a companys business and operations are an externality or cost to the environment and society at large and are developing an internal carbon price system to help inform strategic decisions and guide our transition towards a low-carbon economy
4	We recognize that there are wild-cards - such as technological innovation - that can significantly impact the pace and design of our reductions programs; we have established a cross-functional group of climate experts to inform our reduction roadmaps 
5	Our emission reduction roadmaps are based on a 3-Rs strategy with preference being giving to i) Reducing our emissions through improved efficiency, followed by ii) Investing in renewable technologies and businesses and finally, iii) buying RECs (renewable energy credits) and Offsets 
In Addition, in December 2019 Liberty Mutual announced its global policy on coal underwriting and investing Liberty Mutual will:
	No longer accept underwriting risk for companies where more than 25 percent of their exposure arises from the extraction and/or production of energy from thermal coal
	Not make new investments in debt or equity securities of companies that generate more than 25 percent of revenues from thermal coal mining or utility companies that generate more than 25 percent of their electricity production from thermal coal
	Phase out coverage and investments for existing risks that exceed this threshold by 2023
Liberty Mutual also has a comprehensive Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) program that has oversight from both executive management and the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors

A major component of the Companys ERM program is management of natural catastrophe risk from events such as hurricanes, earthquakes, severe thunderstorms, tornadoes, hail, floods, wildfires, drought, and other natural catastrophes The Company closely monitors changes to the frequency and severity of weather-related natural catastrophes, as well as changing demographic patterns (eg, coastal migration) which could increase potential exposure to climate risk Liberty Mutual rigorously manages its natural catastrophe exposures through its ERM program, utilizing the latest loss simulation models from catastrophe modeling firms AIR Worldwide and Risk Management Solutions As part of its natural catastrophe modeling and exposure management, Liberty Mutual incorporates the most up to date scientific advances in the estimation of the Companys natural catastrophe loss exposure 

A vital function of ERM is establishing exposure and loss thresholds for natural catastrophe events and ensuring the amount of capital at risk does not exceed these thresholds By using both the loss simulation models, as well as historical loss trend data, Liberty Mutual can estimate losses for natural catastrophe events of various magnitudes and probabilities This information is incorporated into strategic planning, pricing, and reinsurance purchasing decisions Reinsurance products, which include traditional reinsurance, sidecars, and other risk transfer mechanisms, are used to ensure that the Companys net losses (and capital at risk) associated with significant natural catastrophe events does not exceed established thresholds

Liberty Mutual has a catastrophe modeling Research and Development (R&D) team that is tasked with identifying opportunities to improve the accuracy of catastrophe modeling tools utilized by the Company for natural catastrophe exposure management This is accomplished by using new scientific research, tools, and technologies to both modify third party models and create internally developed models The R&D team continues to evaluate the credibility of new modeling methodology for perils such as flood and wildfire as they become available All model methodologies are rigorously back tested against prior event losses, with the goal of improving the predictive capabilities of the models for Liberty Mutuals own portfolio of exposures 

With regard to climate change, the R&D team has primarily focused to date on hurricane risk as this is the companys peak peril When evaluating the potential financial impact of losses related to hurricane exposures, Liberty uses current sea levels in storm surge modeling, which explicitly incorporates the impact of this immediate climate peril in the companys view of hurricane risk Liberty Mutual also reviews the warm sea surface temperature (WSST) event catalog alongside the standard long-term historical catalog This WSST event catalog incorporates the estimated increase in frequency and severity of hurricanes in response to sea surface temperatures that are higher than the long-term historical average due to multidecadal internal variability, a potentially useful proxy for future climate change Ongoing work will apply stress tests affecting future changes in frequency and intensity, to assess the sensitivity of the Liberty portfolio of risks to climate change that are not yet fully attributable to climate change in the historical record Although the scientific evidence on hurricane stalling, rapid intensification, and poleward migration is not yet settled, the R&D team is actively monitoring this emerging research to incorporate into future stress scenarios as needed 

Another vital component of the Liberty Mutuals ERM program is its Emerging Risks Committee, which conducts evaluations of risks that are difficult to quantify, continuing to evolve and could have a material impact Liability risks and economic shocks related to climate change are one of the key emerging risks monitored by this Committee 

Increases in climate hazards may also pose a direct risk to business operations, as many employees are located in regions susceptible to increased climate perils Liberty maintains a robust business continuity program to mitigate this ongoing operational risk

Oversight of investment portfolio risks is also a component of the ERM program, as well as the Investment Committee of the Board of Directors

"National Union Fire Insurance Company of Pittsburgh, Pa."," 

i) the scope of process:
At AIG PC, risk management includes the identification and measurement of various forms of risk, the establishment of risk thresholds and the creation of processes intended to maintain risks within these thresholds while optimizing returns We consider risk management an integral part of managing our core businesses and a key element of our approach to corporate governance

We have an integrated, multi-disciplinary process for managing risks throughout our organization in accordance with our firm-wide risk appetite Our Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) Department supervises and integrates the risk management functions in each of our business units, providing senior management with a consolidated view of the firms major risk positions ERM monitors all significant enterprise risks and opportunities on a regular basis, including future, potentially material, risks related to climate change, such as catastrophic weather

To control catastrophe exposure, AIG uses a combination of techniques, including setting key business unit limits based on an aggregate PML (probable maximum loss), monitoring and modeling accumulated exposures, and purchasing catastrophe reinsurance to supplement our other reinsurance protections

With these multiple levels of risk management processes in place and integrated across AIG, modeling and underwriting practices may continue to adapt to the developing risk exposures attributed to climate change

ii) how risks/opportunities are assessed at a company level:
Risks or opportunities related to climate change are assessed at the company level through a multi-layered risk management organizational structure  AIGs Board of Directors oversees the management of risk through the complementary functioning of the Finance and Risk Management Committee and the Audit Committee and interaction with other committees of the Board  Next, the Group Risk Committee (the GRC) is the senior management group charged with assessing all significant risk issues on a global basis in order to protect AIGs financial strength, optimizing intrinsic value, and protecting AIGs reputation among key stakeholders The management committees that support the GRC are charged with identifying, analyzing and reviewing specific risk matters within their respective mandates, and are comprised of senior executives and experienced business representatives from a range of functions and business units throughout AIG and its subsidiaries
	
AIG PC considers climate change as it relates to future risk exposures through an Environmental Working Group (EWG), made up of senior staff from across the organization, including Enterprise Risk Management Following assessments of recent natural catastrophes, AIG recognizes the impact of environmental change on the risk profile The EWG was established to develop a framework for AIG PC to establish a view on the impact and risk of anthropogenic environmental change and its impact on AIGs business This includes better understanding what the climate science indicates about changes to the environment and a strategy to better anticipate changes that can influence AIGs risk profile

An example of a climate change-related (non-hurricane) risk identification and analysis currently being undertaken by AIG PCs Catastrophe Management and Analytics Center of Excellence is the Climate Informed Global Flood Risk Assessment  The project is developing innovative modeling frameworks for local and global flood risk estimation, and supporting them through the integration of rainfall simulation, hydrologic and hydraulic modeling, statistical models, key topography, asset, population density, climate and other socio-economic data bases This will provide a robust platform for the best possible flood risk estimates in a changing climate for actuarial and portfolio analysis using all information sources as they are updated  The project methodology will be applied to several global regions where recent mega-floods have led to concerns, and test the predictive analysis by focusing on key attributes of different settings of interest The model is also intended to assess the financial impacts of flooding of assets at risk within the region(s) for which policies are written, or whose disruption (eg, transportation networks) would result in business disruption or loss of use claims

iii) how risks/opportunities are assessed at an asset level:
Risks and opportunities are generally assessed at an enterprise or business unit level, but the AIG PC EWG is comprised of members from throughout AIGs individual asset levels and business units who may elevate relevant climate-change related risk information up to the enterprise risk level for assessment as appropriate

At a physical asset level, AIG does assess the risks and opportunities associated with the physical impacts of climate change, including individual facilities and office locations AIG has a Business Continuity plan to respond to any incident that may disrupt business operations, including extreme weather events In fact, the impact of Superstorm Sandy crystallized the importance of business continuity planning and the role of insurance The effect of Sandy raised awareness and heightened the perspective of such catastrophic events, particularly in the property and environmental markets

iv) the frequency of monitoring (in weeks/months/years):
Enterprise wide risks are evaluated and monitored at least annually at the multiple governance levels described above (ie, Group Risk Committee and the Operational Risk Committee) The AIG PC Environmental Working Group monitors risks and opportunities on an ongoing basis to guide environmental efforts, including identifying climate change related risks and opportunities

v) criteria for determining materiality/priorities:
Within each business unit, senior leaders and executives approve risk-taking policies and targeted risk tolerance within the framework provided by ERM  ERM supports AIG businesses and management in the embedding of enterprise risk management in all of our key day to day business processes and in identifying, assessing, quantifying, managing and mitigating the risks taken by us and our businesses
Accountability for the implementation and oversight of risk policies is aligned with individual corporate executives, with the risk committees receiving regular reports regarding compliance with each policy to support risk governance at our corporate level as well as in each business unit

vi) to whom are the results reported:
The Finance and Risk Management Committee of the Board of Directors periodically receive updates from AIGs Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) function and review the results of stress tests  Should a risk related to climate change be identified and become material, it would also be elevated through this established ERM process, with the results reported to the Board or Committee of the Board In addition, general accountability for the implementation and oversight of risk policies is aligned with individual corporate executives, with the risk committees receiving regular reports regarding compliance with each policy to support risk governance at our corporate level as well as in each business unit Progress and results of the Environmental Working Group are reported to the Chief Science Officer

Alterra America Insurance Company,"  Below is the overall Markel Group response
General Overview of Survey:
Markel Corporation, the parent and sole shareholder of Alterra America Insurance Company (the Company) views and manages its risks at a consolidated level, not on a per insurance company legal entity basis

The Company's insurance operations are office-based and, consequently, do not produce significant emissions in comparison to, for example, industrial operations  The Company seeks to operate efficiently and to minimize waste, which contributes to reduced emissions

As previously reported, the Company transitioned many key business functions to paperless environments, and similar efforts continued in 2013 within secondary business functions  Also, the Company continues to consolidate data centers where and when possible across Markel North America  In 2013, 5 remote datacenters were consolidated into the datacenter located at the Company's headquarters The Companys goal is to reduce all North American data centers down to 2  While the Company has made significant progress in the prior year in virtualizing our server environment, some effort of desktop virtualization began in 2013   Virtualization is a process whereby applications are run in separate, isolated partitions (separate virtual machines) within a single server Widely used in datacenters, each virtual machine runs its own operating system and application and can be moved or copied from one server to another for load balancing or to expand processing capability Along with greater utilization of hardware, this ""live migration"" feature is one of the major benefits of using virtual servers

The Company's affiliated non-insurance operations tend to engage in light manufacturing or service businesses and are not significant producers of emissions

The combination of data center consolidation and virtualization of computing environments is also expected to significantly reduce power consumption in support of business activities",0

Reliance Standard Life insurance Company," However, because of the controlled risk framework within which we operate, the Tokio Marine Group believes that our portfolios are constructed to withstand a volatile capital market environment that could result if climate change were to impact the planet For example, as a rule, we do not participate in bonds issued by coastal credits or bonds issued by insurance companies While the reasoning behind this decision is not directly related to climate change, we believe that both coastal credits and insurance companies could be negatively impacted should weather patterns become unstable Where an additional risk may exist (ie regulatory, litigation, etc), the Tokio Marine Group and its investment advisers assess and incorporate that risk into the pricing of the investment In addition, the Tokio Marine Groups portfolios are well diversified by sector, subsector, and issuer due to the risk management constraints placed on all of our managed portfolios Due to the vast number of potential outcomes that could result due to climate change or extreme, environmentally stressful events, it is difficult if not impossible to predict winners and losers While rainfall totals or storm frequency may create some short term economic turbulence, climate change is typically a long term phenomenon whose affects are slow to accumulate and, therefore, recognizable well in advance We believe, therefore, that a well-diversified portfolio is the best defense against such occurrences In addition, investment advisors incorporate ESG (Environmental/Social/Governance) measurement and scoring into their credit research and review process when reviewing and determining investments for the Tokio Marine Group",4

The time scale of the changes projected is typically over a period of several decades In the catastrophe accumulation processes Zurich is continuously adjusting to actual developments over time in a manner appropriate for the instruments modeled Catastrophe models typically are updated every five years Zurich considers the impact of climate change on a five year time horizon to be smaller than the impact of the natural cycles (eg ENSO, AMO) and the general variability of catastrophe events

Zurich monitors emerging climate research through internal expertise and gains external insight through the Natural Catastrophe Advisory Council, which is made up of world-class scientists, including an author from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Additionally, Zurich is a member of the Risk Advisory Committee for the Institute for Business and Home Safety  The stated mission of IBHS is to conduct objective, scientific research to identify and promote effective actions that strengthen homes, businesses, and communities against natural disasters and other causes of loss Zurich joined the Risk Prediction Initiative (RPI) this year, which is a membership organization funding academic research relevant to re/insurance industry and translates research into usable results Several PRI projects are explicitly investigating the impact of climate change on atmospheric perils

Risk Sharing and Diversification: Responsible risk sharing, largely from reinsurance, forms the foundation of Assurant's risk mitigation strategy Assurant considers reinsurers as strategic partners and credits transparency to our strong relationships with more than 40 global firms In addition, the diversified composition of Assurant's business portfolio helps to mitigate the impacts from risks associated with a single physical location or business line As we continue to grow our businesses into new regions and markets, we further spread our physical and business risks 
Catastrophe Modeling: Assurant purchases forward-looking catastrophe and storm models from several modeling agencies Our in-house meteorologist, hydrologist and catastrophe modelers also work with modeling agencies to help improve Assurants models Assurant employs a proprietary view of risk, which combines and adjusts results from several models to arrive at a comprehensive annual assessment of our climate-related risk, policy rates and reinsurance costs 
Climate Resilience of Assurant Facilities: We assess all Assurant facilities for exposure to severe climate-related events and recommends improved climate resiliency where appropriate For example, we fortified our Miami, Florida office with hurricane resistance glass that provides protection from hurricanes rated up to category 5 and full electrical generator capacity for use during a tropical cyclone and/or long-term power outage We also provide optional electrical generators to most large facilities, with additional generators for data protection in select locations We strategically relocated our data centers in the United States several years ago, so they are in regions less vulnerable to catastrophic events We also use technology platforms that allow for virtual workstyles and data transfer to other facilities in the case of a severe weather events
Energy, Emissions, Waste: By decreasing our energy and emissions throughout our value chain, Assurant can reduce our operating costs and enhance stakeholder relationships Maintaining efficient operations also reduces the financial and operational risks posed by governments transitioning to low carbon economies, like a carbon tax or stricter environmental regulation At Assurant, we aim to identify, monitor and report our relevant energy consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and improve our energy and emissions intensity At an operational level, we set a goal to reduce energy consumption at our internally managed facilities by a minimum of 2 percent annually for the past eight years To achieve this goal, we invest steadily in energy-efficient lighting and HVAC systems and share best practices from successful facilities with other facility managers on a regular basis

KPs executive leadership has adopted an organizational guideline related to climate change, excerpted below:
If greenhouse gas emissions continue to increase, climate change will cause health effects that will directly impact KPs ability to fulfill our promise of quality affordable care Global climate instability will increase the demand for health care The costs of energy and water are likely to increase while supplies are diminished Threats to biodiversity could also threaten the availability of potential cures for diseases KP adopts the following principles:
1	Understand climate change
2	Assess and avoid climate-related impacts
3	Commit to continuous improvement
4	Support industry standards
5	Inform public policies
As noted in KPs response to question 1, KP is now carbon neutral, largely as a result of large-scale investments in clean and renewable energy sources An added benefit of these investments is that, by providing KP with a long-term fixed price for electricity, they provide KP with an important hedge against potentially significant swings in energy prices resulting from climate impacts and/or climate policies

Mutual of Omaha Insurance Company,"  For example, recent home office remodeling and data center optimization projects will save an estimated 11,293 KWH annually which equates to eliminating 1003 metric tons of CO2 emissions annually 

In an effort to reduce our carbon footprint, we continue to analyze and modernize our HVAC systems by replacing old and outdated equipment with more efficient and modern designs These efforts include,
	Investing in Speed Drive controls on our equipment further reducing our energy demand
	Planning HVAC equipment shutoffs based on personnel schedules 
	Installing new speed controlled pumps to our boiler (50,000kw/yr), LED lighting upgrades (143,000 kw/yr), and continuing to improve the management of our physical plants resources (58,000 kw/yr), all have added to our goal 
Other items to note, 
	We loosened the humidity requirements in our data center allowing for less humidity in the drier months saving additional load on our HVAC systems 
	We have improved the controls on our building air pressure to keep outside conditions from leaking in when doors are opened 
	We continue to adjust our cooling towers set points to take advantage of the colder and drier days whenever possible by making colder water when it is advantageous  
	We continue to invest in the optimization of our existing controls by working with our staff and vendors to understand and adjust the Building Automation System for optimal operation of our facility  
	We are looking at installing newer more modern chemical corrosion treatment systems for our boilers and chillers which will reduce our chemical needs by keeping tighter controls on those systems, which reduces our hazardous material use and waste generation as well as reducing our use of water for those processes

Over the past six years we have made great strides in reducing our carbon footprint through reduction in utility usage Some of those key accomplishments were:
	We have converted our entire headquarters, 18 million sq ft lighting system from T12 technology to T8 electronic bulbs and ballasts 
	Modernization of our HVAC systems has eliminated ozone depleting refrigerants and installed chill water compressors that use EPA approved refrigerants along with Variable Frequency Drives on all air handler units These have reduced our electrical usage over the past six years by over 50%

o	Access to Daylight: having fewer offices and conference rooms on the perimeter of facilities to allow employees to have access and work next to natural daylight
o	Circulation and Connectivity: active paths of travel that result in employee interaction; spaces designed for visual and physical connectivity to encourage interaction between employees; and central areas where employees can gather and eat healthy food options

Catering and Cafeteria 
	Liberty Mutual has two recycling programs for excess food in its Boston facility and Plano, TX facilities 
o	In 2019, the Boston facility diverted 159 tons of organic waste from landfill and donated to a local farm where it is bagged and sold as fertilizer

The American Family group of companies has an Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) function that provides risk reporting to the board of directors (BOD) at least 4 times a year  Annually, the BOD approves the enterprise risk policy that describes the risk appetite and tolerance levels set by senior leadership of the enterprise The policy provides guidance to ensure risk exposures will remain within acceptable boundaries  The guidance provided by the risk policy considers natural catastrophe risk  

To ensure the BOD and executive management receive information about emerging risks, the enterprise has several processes in place to ensure that emerging and evolving risks with the potential to impact the Enterprise continue to be identified ERM has historically facilitated a formal risk interview process annually As part of this process, all areas of the organization participate in risk interviews, including operating company leadership, division leadership, senior leadership and Risk Committee members Risks identified can include those due to changes in processes, new strategies, or external factors such as the changes to the industry and the way we conduct business  One ongoing risk is the impact of severe weather events  While this risk is one that is continuously monitored in the organization, the ERM process considers changes to experience, computer models, and trends identified by experts through ERMs networking and involvement in professional organizations  Exposures are evaluated in relation to capital quarterly to ensure the risk is within tolerance, and therefore, within the stated enterprise risk policy appetite and tolerance

With regard to computer modeling, KP uses customized tools to conduct community health needs assessments in our communities These tools, which are freely available to the public at wwwchnaorg/kp, provide the capacity to view, map and analyze environmental conditions and health outcomes in a particular community, and provide information that can be applied to help any community KP used these tools in 2016 to guide it in conducting and publishing 37 Community Health Needs Assessments (CHNAs) across all of the communities it serves These assessments are helping KP to identify, prioritize and address community health needs including poor health outcomes that are correlated with climate change For example, in KPs Colorado business unit, the units 2016 implementation strategy for addressing community health needs rated climate change as a medium priority health need and noted that: A changing climate poses long-term implications for health today and for future generations Poor air quality exacerbates respiratory and cardiovascular conditions KP Colorado has opportunities to minimize the environmental impact of its facilities through internal programs and to encourage climate friendly transportation through grant-making (Source: wwwkpchnaorg/chna)

Another way that KP manages the risks of climate change is by limiting the carbon (and other environmental) footprint of its healthcare system Greater resource efficiency makes its buildings and operations more resilient to fluctuations in the availability and price of natural resources such as water and energy In 2017, KP reduced its operational GHG emissions by 29 percent compared to its 2008 baseline year KP achieved this reduction due to success in: 1 increasing energy efficiency (for example, several of Kaiser Permanentes buildings have received the US Environmental Protection Agencys Energy Star certification; and one of its California data centers was the first data center in the world to achieve LEED EBLeadership in Energy and Environmental Design for Existing BuildingsPlatinum certification); and 2 voluntarily purchasing enough green power, including both onsite and offsite renewable energy sources, to cover nearly one-third of its electricity needs in 2017
Since 2013, KP has required Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Gold certification for all of its new construction of hospitals, large medical offices and other major projects As of July 2018, 26 of KPs buildings have been LEED-certified With plans to spend roughly $30 billion on hospital and medical office construction between 2013 and 2022, KPs LEED Gold commitment is expected to contribute to a healthier environment by improving the environmental performance of 11 million square feet of real estate, or more than 100 buildings In 2017, KPs pursuit of LEED certifications helped to attract subscriptions by capital market participants to $1 billion in green bonds issued by KP to finance and refinance KPs construction of LEED-certified medical facilities
KPs climate adaptation actions include conducting an inventory of its hospitals using 500-year flood levels to assess vulnerability of its critical systems (eg, power, water) KP is developing plans to protect those systems

CHealth Net Life Insurance Company," The new Centene Clayton campus under construction is striving to achieve the greatest energy efficiency and resulting emissions reduction while respecting local market forces and LEED program commitments The project team has committed to achieve LEED Gold certification for the new campus office buildings 

Our Missouri data center has been built to LEED specifications Our secondary data center, located in California, meets the states Title 24 Building Energy Efficiency Standards Additionally, all our data centers utilize cooling capabilities in order to minimize our power consumption at those sites 

The new campus is also mitigating some of the local effects of climate change by integrating over 26,000 sf of green roof area This serves both to reduce the amount of storm water flow that could contribute to local flooding as well as reducing potential increases to storm energy/intensity due to urban heat island effect through the integration of cool roof strategies In addition to these strategies, the new Centene campus will have greater emergency generator capacity than required by code to ensure safety of building occupancy and greater continuity of building operations during emergency situations

The building which houses our corporate headquarters was built to LEED Gold certification standards Some highlights of this building include: 
	Water usage  35% more efficient than EPAct
	Energy savings  104% over ASHRAE 901-2004
	Building materials  22% of materials from recycled sources; use of Forest Stewardship Council Certified Wood

Also, most of the buildings in which our business units operate are leased properties As such, we have only a limited ability to impact environmental emissions from those facilities

"Arcadian Health Plan, Inc."," As our business evolves to respond to healthcare reform in the United States  through integrated healthcare delivery and operational cost reductions  we are transforming our business strategy to be more agile and responsive to current healthcare trends For example: strategically selecting and managing our changing real estate portfolio of office properties and associated services (such as data centers), expanding our number of medical clinics, and other new facility concepts are core to our success in responding to changing market demands and to the impacts of climate change We have invested staff resources and capital funds to manage risks and opportunities presented by the rising costs of fossil fuel-based energy and to improve building energy efficiency 

Addressing and collecting data on energy usage and intensity in these facilities supports our greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction goals We have committed that by the end of 2022, Humana will achieve a 21%YOY decrease (cumulative 105%) in greenhouse gas emissions from 2017 baseline emissions across our portfolio of owned and leased properties under direct Humana control This goal utilizes the suggested annual reduction based on CDPs science-based target methodology, however is considered a bridge goal due to the shorter target timeframe We support our goals by collecting data on building energy efficiency and green building features when considering new spaces to purchase or lease

To this end, Humana prioritizes support given to energy and emissions reduction projects Humana initiated several large-scale lighting retrofit projects in 2016-2018 at our largest owned facilities, which are projected to reduce annual energy costs by $945,800 We continued to upgrade lighting in 2019 that will save an additional $134,400 per year, for a total annual savings of $1,080,200 going forward In addition, our design standards team, architect and engineering consultants, and facilities team collaborated in 2016 to develop a comprehensive set of design standards for office and clinical operations to ensure consistency, energy efficiency, and sustainable practices across new builds and renovations We are also exploring renewable energy options to determine opportunity and feasibility 

We also partnered with a local electric company to participate in a Demand Response Program On high-energy use days, Humana curbs our electricity usage by turning off common areas and exterior lighting as well as adjusting back-of-the-house systems and asking associates to turn off any unnecessary power consumption  such as desk lamps Not only does this program reduce demand on the regional electrical grid, but it also raises awareness of sensible energy consumption among our associates  We also installed solar panels and reduced our carbon footprint through increased efficiency of our heating and air conditioning systems and software settings that turns off personal computers when theyre not being used

Humana also collaborates with internal and external partners to make joint decisions on data center projects to ensure the strategic use of funds that also provide sufficient returns in terms of energy efficiency We have worked with our equipment partners, done extensive modelling of air flow and cooling loads, and are implementing optimization strategies to minimize the cost of cooling and reduce the temperature differential required, while maintaining the reliability and performance of our data center equipment For example, our IT and Facilities Management teams collaborated to install new building management systems (BMS) at the data centers These systems provide visibility into energy efficiency opportunities such as upgrades to lithium batteries and the addition of smart tiles to enhance the BMS system by monitoring air flows not just at the cabinet level, but also at the overall level We have installed the Tridium system in the Louisville Data Center and are strategically allocating capital funds to pursue projects at the Simpsonville Data Center

A team of internal and external specialists, coordinated by the Sustainability & Operations Manager, provides expertise on opportunities to reduce costs and emissions through operational efficiency and employee engagement on sustainability  In order to identify appropriate goals related to climate impact, and to track progress toward them, Humana calculates and publicly reports Scope 1, Scope 2, and Scope 3 emissions in accordance with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol In 2020, we undertook a more robust Scope 3 assessment to more fully evaluate our impacts along the value chain; this effort will also support our ongoing goal-setting work  The company provides transparency into our goals and progress by voluntarily reporting to CDP and the Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI), in addition to producing a publicly-available Corporate Social Responsibility report

In some of the country units local targets are set  For example, Aegon UK has been working on an intensity target to maintain per capita use of gas and electricity consumption in 2014 at levels which do not exceed 2013  Aegon UK additionally set a target to reduce emissions on short haul flights in 2014 compared to 2013  The UK operations represent between 10% to 15% of Aegons emissions from gas and electricity use and approximately 30% of its short haul air travel 

In 2014 Aegon will further mitigate CO2 emissions by switching to green electricity in the Netherlands  Aegon has been using green electricity in the UK since 2012 

During 2013, Aegon continued to work on a number of local initiatives to further reduce consumption of energy and other raw materials  These initiatives included:

First Penn-Pacifc Life Insurance Company," Lincoln Financial has a long-standing program to actively and intensely monitor and manage energy used in the facilities it owns and operates  Lincoln installed its first large scale centralized automation and energy management system in 1972 at its Fort Wayne campus  From that point on, Lincoln has focused on reducing its energy expense and corresponding carbon footprint through the use of various systems, processes, construction techniques, engineering principles, technology and best practices Energy Star benchmarking has been consistently applied since 2005 and substantial reductions in energy and carbon have been achieved over the last three decades  A comprehensive GHG inventory, inclusive of some aspects of Scope 3 emissions, is compiled by the Office of Corporate Responsibility and the various administrative services teams who are responsible for operating and managing Lincolns many facilities The feasibility of setting further carbon reduction targets is being assessed based on the inventory Since most of Lincoln's carbon emissions are a result of its facility operations, and because of the significant effort expended in reducing energy use in the buildings, substantial new opportunities for reductions in carbon emission are not expected to be identified in the near term, either from an absolute or an intensity perspective 
 
In addition to facility related energy reduction strategies, Lincoln Financial has also adopted electronic document delivery or document suppression initiatives to reduce paper, energy, and fuel usage, and is actively pursuing a broader strategy to extend the scope and utilization of web-based document delivery The Company utilizes Microsoft System Center Configuration Management 2012 for a full range of workstation / server management It allows us to control and configure power management on our systems which helps to identify PC energy conservation opportunities and harvest energy, collaborate with end-users to establish optimal power policies as per the user's PC usage, adopt heighten end-user awareness, increase visibility on end-user behavior, automatically power down computers during non-use, and report on actual savings and positive environmental impact in aggregate and by business unit

Questions to consider include:
	How may climate change shift customer demand for products? The primary impact related to climate change on dental insurance is related to employer groups, and the impact to their operations In the event employers reduce costs as a negative outcome of climate change, we may see dental benefits reduced or cancelled as a cost saving measure 
	What implications may climate change have on liquidity and capital needs? Employer groups dropping dental benefits would negatively impact operations, and thus liquidity
	How might climate change affect limits, cost and terms of catastrophe reinsurance, including reinstatement provisions?  This is not applicable to dental coverage, as far as we can tell
	Has the insurer considered creative methods of risk distribution such as contingency plans to reduce financial leverage and resolve any liquidity issues in the event of a sudden loss in surplus and cash outflows as a result of a catastrophic event? We currently maintain reserves in excess of ten times RBC requirements Our investment portfolio is well diversified and highly liquid
	How are these impacts likely to evolve over time? Does the company have plans to regularly reassess climate change related risks and its responses to those risks? We monitor our ERM on a quarterly basis It includes impacts from loss of major employer groups, with risk thresholds and related mitigation plans

Northwestern Long Term Care Ins. Co.,"  Because it is a financial services company and not a significant source of emissions, the Company has not adopted a formal plan to reduce or mitigate them  Nevertheless, the Company takes seriously the responsibility to minimize its impact on the environment  The following highlights some of the ways the Company addresses this responsibility today

The Company has been doing business for more than 150 years and its principal offices now sit in two locations  The original home office campus sits in downtown Milwaukee and includes buildings ranging in age from 20 to nearly 100 years  Additionally, in 2002, the Company began building a second campus in Franklin, Wisconsin, approximately 12 miles from the downtown campus  At each location the Company has taken different steps appropriate to the age of the facilities
At the downtown campus, the Companys efforts have focused on renovations as well as changes in processes to promote more efficient energy usage  For example, the Company has completed several projects to reduce energy consumption, including:

	Replaced older fluorescent lighting systems with more efficient fluorescent or LED lights and new ballasts,
	Replaced air controllers with high efficiency models,
	Installed automatic sunshades in certain areas,
	Installed occupancy sensors in private offices and conference rooms,
	Recoated the entire roof of one building using a white surface to keep the building cooler in hot weather,
	Installed LED lights in parking structures of both campuses, 
	Altered HVAC schedules to decrease energy usage, and 
	Implemented an extensive energy management system at both campus which monitors daily energy usage in each building and alerts maintenance staff to out-of-pattern changes in consumption that can be promptly addressed From 2010-13, this has resulted in energy usage reductions of 87 percent in electricity, 62 percent in steam, and 266 percent in natural gas, even though occupancy rates have increased dramatically

In addition, the Company recently completed a renovation to our newest downtown building (the Van Buren building), which we expect to become LEED certified  Sustainability aspects of the project include:

	Renovating an existing building, and reusing the exterior skin, framing, structural floors, and roof decking,
	Recycling 80 percent of the construction waste,
	Replacing existing windows with new energy efficient window frames and insulating glass that is 77 percent more efficient,
	Adding insulation to the exterior building walls to improve energy efficiency,
	Locating private offices, conference rooms, and copy areas away from windows to maximize day lighting for building occupants,
	Recovering heat that would otherwise have been discharged out of the building by transferring low grade heat from electrical rooms and interior spaces to heat other areas of the building,
	In the private offices, connecting movement sensors to fan coil units, in addition to lights, to turn them off when the space is not in use,
	Using refrigerants with zero ozone depletion potential, and
	Maximizing the use of energy efficient LED lighting 

Finally, we are in the process of constructing the new Northwestern Mutual Tower and Commons at our downtown campus that will incorporate numerous sustainability features  To prepare for that project, we recently deconstructed an existing building on the site and recycled over 91% of that material  

At the Franklin campus, the Company had the opportunity from the start to consider both sustainability and environmental concerns  Accordingly, this campus includes the following design and construction features:
	Environmentally conscious landscaping efforts including a bog filter system for a water feature, which naturally filters water, and the planting of 125 trees for every tree removed for construction, in addition to maintaining all on-site wetlands and prairies,
	Use of low volatile organic compound materials and paint; various products containing recycled and recyclable material; and high-efficiency window glass and shades to reduce summer heat load,
	Several mechanical innovations designed to reduce energy consumption, including a hybrid approach to an under-floor air distribution system; a chiller plant heat exchanger that allows for expanded hours of use for free cooling operational mode; and a fully integrated building automation system, and
	Some roof areas are specially coated to create a highly reflective surface that helps keep the building cool in hot weather

In addition to these efforts related to buildings and facilities, the Company seeks to mitigate its environmental impact in numerous other ways  For example, the Company has taken several steps to reduce its paper consumption, such as providing electronic pay statements to employees rather than paper paystubs and subsidizing the price of reusable coffee mugs in order to encourage employees to reduce their use of disposable cups while at work  Similarly, the Company has switched from Styrofoam and plastic to china serving wear in several hospitality areas and has arranged for a local urban produce grower to pick up the Companys spent coffee grounds for use in making compost for its gardens  Furthermore, the Company recycles hundreds of tons of paper  The Company has also implemented on-site herb and vegetable gardens at both campuses that grow produce which is used in the Companys employee cafeterias These measures will decrease the amount of waste generated by the Company  

The Company also encourages its employees to minimize the emissions associated with commuting  The Company for many years has encouraged bicycle commuting by providing a secure storage facility for bicycles and making locker and shower facilities available to interested employees  In 2014, the Company placed second in the nation for companies with more than 5,000 employees in the National Bike Challenge Additionally, the Company long has partnered with the Milwaukee County Transit System to offer a Commuter Value Pass program to eligible employees The Company pays half of the cost of a bus pass good for unlimited use on all routes and services  The Company also offers employees: certificates good toward the purchase of privately operated commuter bus tickets for those with relatively longer commutes; an intercampus shuttle program to reduce the number of cars traveling between the Franklin and downtown sites during the workday; a vanpool program; a centralized Intranet facilitation site allowing employees to match with other carpoolers and vanpoolers; a Company sponsored carpooling program which awards preferential parking spaces to participants; and a Company sponsored emergency ride home program  

As one means of quantifying the effectiveness of the Companys efforts towards encouraging its employees to minimize the emissions associated with commuting, an employee transportation survey was conducted in September 2014 at the Companys Franklin Campus   The survey calculates a percentage reduction from a baseline that assumes that every person commutes alone in a conventional vehicle to work  Of the assumed 14,040 commuting trips calculated by the survey, 5,310 trips were made in fuel-efficient vehicles, 534 trips were made via public transportation, 810 trips were avoided due to telecommuting, and 548 trips were made in a carpool  Additionally, 21 different respondents biked to work during the week of the survey, 5 respondents walked to work, and 45 respondents took the Company shuttle to work per day  These efforts resulted in around a 40% reduction in the baseline  

The Company recognizes that its policyowners have a stake in our society and its institutions  Moreover, the Companys efforts to minimize its impact on the environment align closely with its ongoing efforts to promote the efficient use of resources  Accordingly, the Company will continue to seek appropriate opportunities to lessen its impact upon the environment throughout its organization and operations

The company is in the  eighth year of executing several initiatives to reduce paper use and mail volume  All locations have recycling programs for paper and batteries as well as beverage containers  With the implementation of paperless technologies for its largest book of business in California, the Claims and Underwriting Departments have been increasing electronic recordkeeping and correspondence through the use of mobile enabled customer portal, enterprise content management (ECM), electronic signature and workflow systems which have significantly reduced paper file creation and mailing  The company  utilizes e-Sign capabilities and paperless operations in all of its core operational areas  Core insurance software systems utilize digital capture and workflow technologies  The company continues to accelerate its Digital Strategies to conduct business electronically wherever possible including the use of Electronic Signature technology with its agents and customers and for internal document approval, and the company supports electronic delivery of billing notices and other policy documents, at the option of the consumer and as permitted by law  In the technology operations area, the company has achieved 94% server virtualization  Additionally, the company is in its ninth year of a Managed Print initiative that has resulted in achieving 30% duplex printing and has completed an upgrade of  all printers and multi-function devices to the latest Energy Star compliant multi-function printer devices Additionally, the company has substantially eliminated the use of personal desktop printers and is reducing its document printing operations with eDelivery initiatives The company also implemented a customer portal for its homeowner policy holders  to further promote electronic document delivery that will result in reducing the need for mailing homeowner policy information 

Three of the five company-owned office buildings in California have undergone LED lighting retrofits, including the addition of computerized lighting control systems  The remaining two buildings will be completed in the future  The mechanical equipment servicing these buildings is being enhanced to better protect the environment, while decreasing their per unit energy consumptions Upon completion of this project, the company will be operating five buildings that will have the Energy Star rating  All buildings will also be using recycled paper wherever possible, and recycled paper towels exclusively  The Company is in phase 3 of the Southern California Edison Charge Ready program for electric vehicle charges at two owned building locations in Brea, California, that should be completed by 2020

Compwest Insurance Company," Emissions are tracked through Energy Star The building was Energy Star certified in 2014 with a score of 90  We continue to use Energy Star for tracking and maintained a score of 97 at the end of 2017 Our 2nd largest facility, received Energy Star certification in 2016 with a score of 97 

Several projects are taking place that have or should result in reduction in emissions:  
	Conversion to LED lighting continued in 2017, this initiative will be an ongoing effort 
	In 2017, AF Group diverted rainwater for cooling steam condensate, thus reducing annual usage in fresh water by 250,000 gallons
To reduce equipment run time and electrical usage, modifications were completed to reduce run time of HVAC equipment afterhours

Sentry Life Insurance Company of New York,"  This modeling is done as part of Sentrys catastrophe reinsurance purchasing process  It also relies on these models when making decisions on exposure aggregations  

Each model has its proficiencies and deficiencies within certain sub-sections of Sentrys book of business  The models are compared to Sentrys history of actual catastrophe losses in order to give added context to the models  Sentry also utilizes mapping tools to evaluate and assess exposures

Horace Mann Property and Casualty Insurance,"	Re-underwriting programs bring to the attention of our policyholders any deviations from our underwriting standards that increase the risk potential of the exposure  Insureds are asked to remediate issues creating the increased risk  

b	Premium rates that are consistent with the risk assumed by the companies give policyholders a direct financial incentive to mitigate the risk they present  We believe that by charging a rate appropriate for the risk and not asking less risky exposures to subsidize more risky exposures, we are helping to ensure insurance availability going forward 

c	Limits on policies encourage policyholders to evaluate potential losses and appropriately insure or potentially limit the total financial loss insured

"CHA HMO, Inc.","  Humana is committed to integrating green building principles into our existing and new portfolio of facilities with a focus on energy and water efficiency Humana advanced this objective through the integration of climate and sustainability factors such as energy efficiency projects at our facilities, access to transportation, Energy Star or LEED ranking, employee engagement (ie, behavioral change) and other parameters, into the decision criteria used to improve our facility portfolio and select future Humana locations  Opportunities for improving the portfolio and achieving energy and GHG reduction goals are identified by the Workplace Solutions team in collaboration with our external consulting partners  Initiatives may be evaluated and presented to the senior management for support and funding including capital investment, employee involvement (ie, resource support) or other requirements  

Our short-term strategy is informed by our environmental goals, influencing our team to focus on energy efficient operations within our owned and leased facilities, spurring direct investment in both financial and personnel resources These investments have enabled Humana to implement initiatives to achieve our targets such as an ongoing portfolio-wide LED lighting retrofit, which will result in over $945,800 in annual energy savings, as well as continued alignment with our previously developed comprehensive set of design standards for office and clinical operations to ensure consistency, energy efficiency, and sustainable practices across new builds and renovations Over the course of four years, we invested more than $58 million in building efficiency improvements, optimized our building occupancy rate, and implemented new energy-efficient processes and recycling standards Additional focus on infrastructure projects such as consistent BMS systems in our owned sites will create energy efficiencies We are also exploring renewable energy options to determine opportunity and feasibility toward setting a science-based target Finally, ongoing workspace optimization efforts increase workspace density while also decreasing building vacancies, thereby reducing our physical footprint and alleviating commute burden to reduce energy usage and emissions  

On the whole, energy use reduction and greenhouse gas emissions reduction efforts not only drive progress toward our sustainability goals, but also illustrate to our employees and customers our commitment to reduce GHG emissions and operate as efficiently as possible Employee engagement efforts include a continuing focus on increasing work from home with the understanding that this strategy will have a significant impact on Scope 3 emissions, while providing our workforce greater flexibility and reducing operational demands of our facilities

Our long-term strategy is impacted by potential consequences of climate change such as regulation, natural resource scarcity, facility operational costs and human health impacts Our Workplace Solutions leaders review short- and long-term trends and impacts associated with sustainability and refine our business strategy accordingly For example, Humana's portfolio includes both owned and leased assets where many facility investments are on a long-term basis (up to 10 years) Our sustainable real estate approach ensures these investments take into consideration the long-term impacts of building characteristics on climate change and overall environmental impact, employee wellness, and operational costs

Highmark Casualty Insurance Company," This includes the Parent company and HMIG headquarters offices in Pittsburgh and corporate data centered near Hershey, PA We perform energy audits of these facilities to identify projects that will conserve energy and help meet our energy management strategy goals For Pittsburgh facilities, we have set goals of 10% energy reduction by 2015 and 50% by 2030  We have met the 2015 and 2030 energy goals for this Pittsburgh facility and achieved ENERGY STAR certification in 2016, 2017 and 2018 Because ENERGY STAR certified buildings are verified to use 35% less energy, on average, than similar buildings, they can also be verified to contribute 35% fewer greenhouse gas emissions to our atmosphere",0
First Investor Life Insurance Company," All FIL Company office space and related infrastructure support is leased As such, while the company makes a concerted and ongoing effort to be more energy efficient (ex: use of enhanced lighting and climate controls, reduced paper use), this has not been done as part of an overall documented plan, rather just being good corporate citizens and business partners

American Family Home," Therefore both aspects are included in the Business Strategy
Commitment to conserving natural resources is an equally important part of our corpo-rate responsibility strategy, given that our economic success is inseparably linked with protecting people and the environment With this in mind, we are recording our envi-ronmental data with increasing precision: in 2012, a total of 80% of all Munich Re Group-wide employees in 31 units were covered by our environmental management system, with 30% working in units that have been certified to ISO-14001
To help raise public awareness regarding climate change, we endeavor to set a good example ourselves: by 2015, we will make business operations throughout our Group carbon-neutral The first step was to reduce emissions Group-wide by at least 10% per employee, based on emissions in 2009 In a second step, we are neutralizing unavoid-able CO2 emissions by means of appropriate certificates Our Munich site has been carbon-neutral since 2009, as have the major locations of ERGO Germany since 2011
This objective was achieved for the whole reinsurance group in the reporting year 2012 Since the end of 2012, for example, more than 3087 acres of solar panels have been supplying power to our Princeton corporate campus with a maximum generating capacity of 3042 gigawatt hours per year Our subsidiary DKV Seguros in Spain, which already achieved the objective in 2007, last year became the first European insurer to have its products certified as carbon-neutral Altogether, we have saved more than 5,500 tones of CO2 globally since 2009 with our consistent environmental manage-ment
Source: Annual Report Munich Re Group 2012, page 113
To mitigate CC, in-house green building and energy efficiency play a vital part in facility manage-ment/procurement This approach is supported internally by an Environmental Management System (EMS) and a Group-wide target of carbon neutrality by 2015 with a global reduction of 10% in our emissions (baseline 2009), which will in turn reduce operational costs This being achieved through more efficient energy use, less business travel, use of green power, investment in renewable energy and the off-setting of any remaining carbon emissions through the purchase of carbon credits Various smaller-scale projects to mitigate emissions are already in place Furthermore we concentrate espe-cially on making fewer business trips and reducing our consumption of paper, water and energy Each entity follows their own Carbon Reduction Plan as the local environment/surrounding is playing a cru-cial part, in order to support the Group-wide target
The EMS currently covers 75% of our employees and will be expanded further by 2015 Our EMS monitors our CO2 emissions annually, enabling us to develop measures to reduce them  detailed re-duction plans are in place

"BCBSM, Inc","  To the extent that climate change impacts our claims or administrative expenses or processes over time, we believe we will be able to anticipate this change  in our product pricing and our operational plans  We believe climate change risks are similar across all of Minnesota which is where the majority of our members are located 
	We also believe that we are in a position to react quickly in the event that an extreme weather event impacts our members  As an example, when Hurricane Katrina occurred, we were quickly able to identify members who were located in the affected are and make adjustments to help them get access to needed prescriptions",3
American Family Home," An in-depth understanding of risks is the basis of Munich Res business, and CC is closely linked to our core business as it can have a financial impact on nearly all of our lines of business There are different types of risk (ranging from regulatory to physical and others), which are monitored and evaluated by specialist departments, integrated into Munich Res Internal Control System While we are in a position to adequately assess the known risks in our portfolio on the basis of current climate research, scientific research into CC is complex and the political and regulatory environment in which we operate is developing fast: We must remain vigilant with regard to the identification/evaluation of new and changing risks If new findings in climate research or actual claims development necessitate adjustments in risk assessment, we are able to make these changes promptly because the contractual periods of most of our natural hazards covers are only one year However, changes in the physical environment and new regulations with re-gard to CC also open up many business opportunities  ie through new insurance products for re-newable energy technologies or coverage for extreme weather events
ii) CC represents one of the greatest risks of change for the insurance industry In the Corporate Cli-mate Centre within the GeoRisksResearch unit (GEO/CCC), we analyze and assess climatic effects and are developing a holistic strategic approach Findings are made available to all business areas and all business fields (reinsurance, primary insurance and asset-liability management) The main tool is our risk management discipline, which is firmly embedded in all our business operations We moni-tor and assess all identifiable risks holistically for both sides of the balance sheet
As our own operations and sites are primarily subject to physical risks (see iii), we incur most of our risks/risk types through business with our clients:
a) Risks customers transfer to us: We have specialist departments with expertise in risk manage-ment, underwriting and climate issues
b) Emerging risks: We track all kinds of risks constantly and have a competence centre that continu-ously monitors global issues, as new risk potentials and accumulation hazards are emerging, not only for economies but also relating to physical, regulatory, liability and health risks Together with Corporate Underwriting (CU), experts ensure that CC considerations are incorporated in our risk assessment/management, business/product development and asset management Research find-ings are passed on to CU and Integrated Risk Management (IRM) and used for product de-sign/pricing, accumulation control and adjustments to natural catastrophe models, and are also factored into our risk capital model calculations and risk strategy Risk information is collated by IRM and incorporated in control, management and operational processes at the relevant units Weprovide individual support in the quantification and management of CC risks A core component in the identification of risks is an IRM approach involving underwriters/client managers to ensure di-rect access to markets and dialogue with clients, ie an early-warning system that ensures that physical and regulatory risks are identified and assessed at an early stage, and Centers of Com-petence with experts who specialize in risk identification and analysis in specific lines such as lia-bility and geo risks research In all this, we use models based on assumptions and parameters that are continually checked for plausibility and comprehensibility, also by the Board of Management Common sense is indispensable in these considerations, as is the readiness to challenge the re-sults of calculations by means of stress tests and scenario analyses It is not possible, of course, to properly identify every risk or to always assess the correlations between different risks correctly But as recent years show, we have succeeded relatively well  also during the financial crisis  in taking sensible decisions on the basis of our risk management systems
iii) a) Risks arising out of investments in companies with high physical exposure to CC/exposure to changes in CO2 legislation; ie change in regulatory framework, not being prepared for emission trad-ing, energy-efficient production: this could result in higher operational costs/lower returns, and the same applies to cover for litigation risks We also integrate/translate our expertise in CC risks and op-portunities into new solutions for our asset management, eg a special sustainability fund We analyze not only risks, but also the business opportunities of companies in which we invest By the end of 2012, Munich Re has invested US $13bn in our RENT (Renewable Energy and New Technologies) program, rising to US $33bn in the coming years
b) We monitor risks for our sites and subsidiaries, ie meteorological risks of CC, such as storm, flooding or other extreme weather events that have a direct impact on us, ie on our buildings and on IT/other infrastructure As regards our ability to continue operations, each site and subsidiary maintain a detailed Business Continuity Plan; and specialized teams for exceptional circumstances are in place
iv) We constantly analyze known/emerging risks to determine whether there have been changes in their structure/occurrence probability, also focusing on identifying new risks at an early stage to offer solutions for risks up until now uninsurable Both risks and opportunities at all levels are constantly (daily) assessed by specialist departments and coordinated by GEO/CCC We also identify trends/faint signals in many ways, including systematic trend research and regular structured discus-sions in our Emerging Risks Think Tank (group of internal experts, meeting monthly) They derive conceivable scenarios and analyze their possible impact on Munich Re, also looking at interdepend-encies between different risks and other consequences related directly or indirectly to emerging risks Cooperation with external partners complements our internal early-warning system
v) As our business is insuring risks, the criteria for determining priorities/materiality are included in our business strategy approach such as loss probability and intensity: CC poses a serious risk of change to the insurance industry, so Munich Re started to investigate it from as early as 1973: a special re-search team was set up in 1974 to build up know-how in GeoRisks and CC Since 2007, a Group-wide CC Strategy covering all aspects  such as weather-related impact, regulatory impact and litigation risks  has supported our core Corporate Strategy The holistic approach embraces mitigation, adap-tation, research, in-house CO2 reduction and political advocacy as the main pillars to combat CC Mit-igation and adaptation in particular enable us to identify business opportunities/priorities
vi) Reporting line and responsibilities of the Munich Re Board of Management: 1 Company and business-related risks/opportunities: direct reporting line to CEO Reinsurance (Board Member) Dr Jeworrek Status/results of projects/business development in the context of Climate Change are reported twice a year  relevant decisions also to the Reinsurance Committee to ensure that they are integrated into our core business strategy

Standard Life Insurance Company of New York,"  We recognize that the company has an associated carbon footprint through daily business operations and the organization is working to assess, reduce and mitigate these emissions
 
The Standard assessed the organizations carbon emissions in 2009 for base year 2008, measuring emissions in Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 categories (direct on-site combustion of natural gas, direct energy purchasing, and indirect emissions from various sources) This initial assessment focused on areas within the companys control, including natural gas and electricity consumption for company-owned properties and leased properties at the corporate headquarters in Portland, Oregon The assessment also identified emissions that were associated with core business operations, including emissions from staff commuting, business travel, land-filled garbage from the corporate headquarters, embodied emissions from paper purchasing nationwide, as well reduced carbon emissions from renewable energy credits purchased annually 

In terms of emission reduction and mitigation, the organization conducts intentional initiatives to reduce our environmental  and carbon  impact while simultaneously reducing costs and improving operational efficiencies 

The corporate Green Team is integral in the success of these initiatives, and all employees are encouraged to offer ideas for innovation and conservation 

The Standard received the City of Portlands Sustainability at Work gold workplace certification in 2019 Sustainability at Work offers three levels of certification to recognize a businesss positive effect on the environment and our community Certified applicants are evaluated on more than 70 factors related to their environmentally friendly practices in the areas of recycling/reuse, employee engagement, transportation, energy, water, and community engagement Gold certificate recipients must meet a minimum of 45 practices to qualify

At company-owned facilities, measures are in place to reduce electrical, heating and cooling demands as a result of upgrades The Tanasbourne building, for example, was built to be 34 percent more efficient than a conventional building of the same size and type These upgrades also involved careful planning to reduce the amount of product waste through the day to day operations of the facilities, ultimately sending less waste to the landfill to create methane gas through decomposition The Standard has partnered with the Energy Trust of Oregon to complete assessments and efficiency retrofits resulting in significant reduced electricity consumption in both office space and data center operations 

Computer equipment and hardware for printing, scanning and copying is Energy Star certified to further reduce electrical demand, and computers have been set to enter the power-saving mode after a period of inactivity from the user Many enterprise-wide software and desktop applications include scan features, eliminating the need for the creation or storage of paper documents  All employees are encouraged to turn off computers, equipment and lights when not in use; this practice is enhanced with a PC power management software tool which reduces power use when machines are not in active use Linear lighting in our office buildings uses LED bulbs

The companys data center, housed in a building that meets several LEED standards, sources electricity that consists of 38% from renewable resources The data center also incorporates energy efficient features that make it significantly more energy efficient than traditionally built data centers, including the use of LED lighting, motion sensors and energy efficient cooling technology

Business and staff travel is a large component of The Standards carbon footprint For staff commuting, the organization has made significant strides to reduce the amount of single-occupancy vehicle trips Having the headquarters located in downtown Portland makes it convenient for employees to use alternate modes of transportation such as public transit, biking, walking or carpooling The Standard offers a strong incentive for employees to use these modes of transit Prior to the pandemic, nearly 60% of The Standards 2,100 Portland employees walked, biked, carpooled, participated in a carshare, rideshare or took public transit as their primary commute method; subsidies and reimbursement are offered to employees who use public transit or carpool to work; sheltered, secure bike parking is available The Standard operates three electric vehicle charging stations in a company-owned garage, participating in the federal EV Project Business travel, however, offers fewer alternatives, and certainly represents a large portion of annual carbon emissions 

In early 2020, all 3,000 employees of The Standard were provided access to Microsoft Teams, an integrated business communication platform to engage more efficient and effective collaboration without the necessity of travel As we transition to a post-pandemic workplace, we expect a significant percentage of our employees will continue to work remotely without the need for commuting, and we will continue to prioritize remote meeting technologies over business travel where possible 

The Standards supply chain also seeks opportunities to reduce emissions associated with both supply delivery and embodied emissions of materials The company uses copier/printer paper that contains at least 30% recycled content, centralized printers are available and paperless workflow alternatives are used whenever possible

American Economy Insurance Company," Liberty Mutual has a comprehensive Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) program that has oversight from both executive management and the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors

A major component of the Companys ERM program is management of natural catastrophe risk from events such as hurricanes, earthquakes, severe thunderstorms, tornadoes, hail, floods, wildfires, drought, and other natural catastrophes The Company closely monitors changes to the frequency and severity of weather-related natural catastrophes, as well as changing demographic patterns (eg, coastal migration) which could increase potential exposure to climate risk Liberty Mutual rigorously manages its natural catastrophe exposures through its ERM program, utilizing the latest loss simulation models from AIR and Risk Management Solutions As such, Liberty Mutual incorporates the most up to date scientific advances in the estimation of the Companys natural catastrophe loss exposure 

A vital function of ERM is establishing exposure and loss thresholds for natural catastrophe events and ensuring the amount of capital at risk does not exceed these thresholds By using both the loss simulation models as well as historical loss trend data, Liberty Mutual is able to estimate losses for natural catastrophe events of various magnitudes and probabilities This information is incorporated into strategic planning, pricing, and reinsurance purchasing decisions Reinsurance products, which include traditional reinsurance and alternative risk transfer mechanisms such as sidecars are used to ensure that the Companys net losses (and capital at risk) associated with significant natural catastrophe events does not exceed established thresholds
Liberty Mutual has a catastrophe modeling Research and Development (R&D) team that is tasked with identifying opportunities to improve the accuracy of catastrophe modeling tools utilized by the Company for natural catastrophe exposure management This is accomplished by using new scientific research, tools and technologies to both modify third party models and create internally developed models Specific to climate change, the R&D team focuses on models for hurricanes and severe convective storms, which comprise the majority of the Companys natural catastrophe exposure All model improvements are rigorously back tested against prior event losses, with the goal of improving the predictive capabilities of the models for Liberty Mutuals own portfolio of exposures

When evaluating the potential financial impact of losses related to hurricane exposures, Liberty Mutual reviews the warm sea surface temperature (WSST) event catalog This WSST event catalog incorporates the estimated increase in frequency and severity of hurricanes in response to sea surface temperatures that are higher than the long-term historical average Another vital component of the Liberty Mutuals ERM program is its Emerging Risks Committee, which conducts evaluations of risks that are difficult to quantify, continuing to evolve and could have a material impact Liability risks related to climate change are one of the key emerging risks monitored by this Committee 
Oversight of investment portfolio risks is also a component of the ERM program, as well as the Investment Committee of the Board of Directors",1

Geisinger Health Plan," Catastrophic flooding in the region could impact Geisingers physical locations and equipment, and prevent patient and staff access to facilities, which could ultimately limit operations while impacted by flooding 

In order to identify and manage the risk associated with flooding, Geisinger works closely with their property insurer who conducts flood analytics and modeling and provides access to flood mapping capabilities to visualize and monitor Geisingers facilities relative to high hazard flood zones over time 

Locations that are identified as being located within high hazard zones are further evaluated for potential impact, and if necessary, Flood Emergency Response Plans are developed and implemented to physically protect the location and provide detailed procedures to limit the impact to Geisingers operations in the event of a flooding event
 
Climate risks have the potential to cause health-related exposures to our insurance members and patients  We strive to enhance our risk mitigation efforts to reduce health risks which evolve during a catastrophic event or pandemic  These mitigations protect our community and members we serve as well as reducing the financial impacts caused by a Catastrophic event

Sun Life and Health Insurance Company U.S.,"  Although there is no separate policy on climate change, we consider climate risk as part of the various processes as articulated below 


The Executive Risk Committee has the highest level of direct responsibility for climate change The primary function of the Executive Risk Committee is to assist the Board of Directors with oversight of risk management on an enterprise-wide basis, and of the risk management function more generally It is responsible for actively monitoring and advising the Board on Sun Lifes overall risk profile, risk appetite, and risk management strategies and for overseeing the implementation of those strategies

Our cross-functional North American Investments Environmental Committee works to identify and assess environmental risks across our investment assets while our International Sustainability Council convenes on broader environmental and sustainability issues, and promotes Sun Lifes Sustainability Strategy to the organization We report on environmental management annually in our Sustainability Report, which is approved by the Governance, Nomination & Investment Committee of the Board of Directors 

In 2017, Sun Life Investment Management(1) began developing a formal climate change investment strategy as a part of codifying the asset management businesss stand-alone sustainability principles for addressing non-financial risks/issues in both our business practices and investment management operations


Risk management procedures with regard to climate change risks are integrated into multi-disciplinary company-wide risk management processes At Sun Life, the Risk Management Framework prescribes protocol and programs to help ensure that risks to business undertakings are appropriately managed to achieve business objectives over time and dont exceed pre-established boundaries for risk taking This Framework sets out key mandatory risk management processes in the areas of risk: appetite, identification, measurement, management, monitoring and reporting It covers all risks, grouped into six categories: credit, market, insurance, business and strategic, operational and liquidity risks This broad range of risks includes environmental and climate change risks due to the direct or indirect negative impacts of environmental events and changes, including those related to climate change and the shift towards a lower-carbon economy Impacts can include, but are not limited to, damage to real estate, reduced value of investment assets tied to fossil fuels, health impacts to impacted populations, and socio-economic and geo-political changes In general, all business segments employ a common approach and have accountability for identifying, measuring and managing risks facing their businesses

We have a process to identify and monitor emerging risks that may have a material impact on our finances, operations or reputation We evaluate potential correlations between various risk events and categories, and monitor emerging risks, regulatory and rating agency requirements, and industry developments The Risk Management Framework, corporate strategy, and business objectives are all aligned, and risk management protocols and programs are embedded within every business segment

COMBINED LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY OF NEW YORK," Climate change is contributing to higher sea surface temperatures, rising sea levels and an increasing trend in extreme weather events, including floods, droughts, winter storms, heat waves, wildfires and hurricane intensity These weather events are colliding with the realities of urbanization  the growing exposures from the concentration of people and values created by the longterm shift from rural to urban living, including suburban sprawl  and so many located near water and wilderness because thats where people want to live Add to that government social policies that insulate people and society from the true costs of their decisions Hurricanes Florence, Michael and Harvey were significant events causing record flooding in the US Meanwhile, 2018 was the deadliest and most destructive wildfire season on record in California following 17s recordsetting wildfires Given the longterm threat and the shortterm nature of politics, the failure of policymakers to address climate change, including these issues and the costs of living in or near highrisk areas, is an existential threat As an underwriting company, our job is to understand, structure and assume climate changerelated risk for a fair price, and only do so to the extent of our balance sheet wherewithal and our ability to spread the risk to thirdparty capital Our approach to underwriting is factbased and relies on both our own experience and scientific expertise, and that of the expert network we engage outside our organization Climate risk is complex and requires a deep and evolving understanding of the physical processes causing weather extremes These tools are improving and are providing better insights to aid in how we think about these perils, but much remains unknown For example, what were traditionally nonmodeled risks can now be better analyzed, but flood models, for instance, are more advanced than those for wildfire, which remain relatively crude We also recognize that no matter how good, there is still much basis risk in our conclusions However, keep in mind that natural catastrophes are a shorttail risk, so losses are understood relatively quickly, and we can in most cases react to what we observe

Climate change is integrated into Chubbs strategies: the business (related financial risks and opportunities); operations (steps taken to reduce Chubbs GHG emission and ensure continuity of operations); and philanthropy (support of programs that further environmental stewardship)

The most important business strategy components influenced by climate change are changing hazards and opportunities Chubb uses internal and external data together with sophisticated analytical, catastrophe loss and risk modeling techniques to ensure an appropriate understanding of risk, including diversification and correlation effects, across different product lines and territories We recognize that climate changes and weather patterns are integral to our underwriting process and we continually adjust our process to address these changes This approach is intended to help ensure that losses are contained within our risk tolerance and appetite for individual product lines, businesses and Chubb as a whole Chubb has adjusted the pricing of some insurance lines, such as catastrophe-exposed property insurance and reinsurance, to reflect the high number and severity of natural catastrophes in recent years Because we are a global company, we consider all territories globally as potentially affected by climate risk

Our strategy has also been influenced indirectly, as Chubb provides clients with insurance and reinsurance protection from the impact of natural catastrophes, including weather events that may be more frequent or severe due to climate change Business lines that may be impacted include energy, marine, property and crop insurance coverage However, the same risks also present opportunities For example, Chubb has built on its environmental underwriting and product leadership due to commercial interest resulting from increased regulation of carbon emissions and the move to develop renewable and alternative energy projects around the world Further, by combining the product and risk management expertise of its Construction, Energy and Marine industry groups, Chubb addresses perils that occur in the construction and operation of a renewable energy project

Chubb has also gained business opportunities related to the regulatory aspects of climate change Chubbs risk appetite, expertise and financial strength enable the company to assume a leadership position in insuring the developing areas of regulated GHG emissions, enhancements to existing products or entirely new product lines required by the potential for increased regulation of greenhouse gases globally, as well as emerging related exposures, such as directors & officers and professional liability As regulation and awareness increase, these coverages are expected to grow in demand

Additionally, as part of its underwriting process, Chubb regularly applies exclusions, which depend on the specific conditions and circumstances of the risk being evaluated Those exclusions may reflect ESG-related considerations For example, Chubb is among the worlds largest global underwriters of environmental liabilities and pollution risks However, Chubbs underwriting in this business restricts any participation in certain industries, including mining and reclamation operations, oil refining, pipeline and distribution operations and chemical manufacturing and distribution As another example, a company's ESG profile has a large effect on whether we will underwrite its Director's and Officers (D&O) insurance Since Chubb's exact underwriting criteria is proprietary and critical to its ability to compete effectively, we keep that underwriting criteria non-public and confidential

Chubbs strategy includes reducing GHG emissions from its own operations In 2014, Chubb announced a goal of reducing emissions by 10% per employee by 2020 from a 2012 baseline From 2012 to 2015, Chubbs GHG emissions per employee were reduced by 5% In 2016, ACE acquired The Chubb Corporation and adopted the Chubb name From 2015 to 2017, the combined Chubb organization reduced absolute global emissions by 11% In 2019, Chubb set a companywide goal to reduce our global greenhouse emissions by 20% on an absolute basis by 2025 and 40% by 2035 Both goals use 2016 emissions levels as the baseline Chubbs goals are aligned with the 2-degree Celsius target outlined in the Paris Climate Agreement, as well as the science-based standards methodology of the United Nations Environment Program

As a result of the culmination of years of energy-savings improvements, Chubbs office in Philadelphia earned LEED Silver certification in 2009 Over the next five years, Chubb increased energy efficient lighting (raising the Energy Star score from 72 to an 84), supported alternative commuting and implemented other green building initiatives at the location As a result, in 2014, the Philadelphia building earned LEED Gold recertification Our Bermuda office was re-certified LEED Gold in 2019

In the current reporting year, substantial business decisions influenced by climate change include Chubbs internal operations Initiatives to reduce workstation size and consolidate office space have resulted in a significant reduction in space per employee Chubb also invested in and implemented energy audits and efficiency improvements within our owned and long-term leased spaces Recent energy efficiency upgrades within three of our offices (in 2018, Whitehouse Station, NJ) enabled Chubb to reduce GHG emissions Further projects are underway

Chubbs philanthropy prioritizes environmental programs Through the Conservation Funds Chubb Land Legacy Fund, Chubb has provided over $1 million in funding since 2006 for the conservation of more than 345,000 acres of critical lands and water resources in the US The Chubb Charitable Foundation partnered with The Nature Conservatory to provide the continuation and expansion of coral reef restoration in the Mesoamerican Reef This effort resulted in transplanting 10,000 new coral colonies and establishing restoration sites The Foundation also funded a project with The Nature Conservancy  to conduct a restoration and resilience project in Florida to demonstrate the flood protection benefits of nature-based solutions For over 20 years, Chubb has supported the Bermuda National Trust with nearly $450,000 in grants to help preserve precious natural reserves and woodlands The Chubb Charitable Foundation also supports the environmental sustainability of cultural institutions Through a Foundation grant, the Philadelphia Museum of the American Revolution was recently awarded a LEED Gold certification for its commitment to energy conservation and environmental awareness Chubb additionally has an ongoing relationship with the American Forests Global ReLeaf®, wherein one tree is planted for each Environmental Insurance policy bound

The Providence Mutual Fire Insurance Company,  Our asset management guidelines are risk adverse and allow us flexibility to respond to any climate related event,4
"UnitedHealthcare of Illinois, Inc."," These strategies are implemented through energy supply contracts, which involve procuring energy outside of the regulated utility tariff For example, the environmental management team analyzes the deregulated energy market to develop electricity and natural gas procurement strategies In 2019, these energy supply contract opportunities resulted in an annual deregulated market savings and cost avoidance of $428,340 from purchasing energy at tariffs lower than the regulated utility tariff, which offset the increases in costs across regulated markets

To manage risks associated with extreme weather events, natural disasters and aging utility infrastructure which have a potential to impact our facilities and business operations (and supporting infrastructure upon which our facilities and operations rely, including utilities and transportation network), we incorporate comprehensive energy and environmental management into our Enterprise Real Estate Services platform and collaborate with the Enterprise Resiliency and Response team which is responsible for monitoring weather-related risks and opportunities having the potential to impact business operations  We utilize a risk-based, comprehensive business continuity planning process, which includes risk scenario-based annual exercises and written contingency plans, and our 24x7 facilities services incident management operations center Additionally, we have identified critical operational sites within our portfolio that are at highest risk of mission impact, and most susceptible to utility outages and related impacts  Accordingly, we developed an investment strategy to deploy backup emergency systems at these critical sites to mitigate the potential effects of extended power outages The multi-million-dollar investment was focused on sites with a higher degree of risk as assessed from an operations perspective  Of particular focus were our core pharmaceutical distribution centers The multi-million-dollar investment to deploy backup emergency systems is considered a one-time capital expense

First Specialty Insurance Corporation," Therefore, it is important that we also take a long-term view on the risk factors that may have an adverse impact on our portfolio, which includes climate change Hence, sustainability and climate change are essential topics for us  The overall responsibility to monitor our commitment to responsible investment lies with the Group Chief Investment Officer, advised by the Asset Management Executive Team and the Asset Management Investment Committee Furthermore, an ESG Advisory Group, formed by representatives of all investment units, legal, compliance and risk management, oversees and monitors the progress of our responsible investment activities and ensures that our commitment is reflected in our day-to-day activities

Our asset management has a well-defined framework, which considers ESG criteria consistent with the Groups Code of Conduct, and is a commitment to sustainability This pledge is further outlined in the Group Asset Management Responsible Investment Policy, which describes our approach and principles in relation to sustainability in the management of Swiss Res investments to ensure the integration of ESG considerations The policy outlines in particular the principles for all responsible investing activities which include the investment strategy and asset allocation, investment selection and portfolio monitoring, voting (through the reference to the Swiss Re Voting Framework) and engagement as well as reporting for Asset Management overall 

This shows Swiss Re is committed to investing its assets responsibly via a controlled and structured investment process, integrating environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria Thus, we apply sustainability related risk information consistently across our entire investment portfolio Material outcomes are incorporated into our investment decision making

At the core of our approach to tackling ESG-related risks in investments is the Sustainability Risk Framework This framework enables us to identify and analyse potential ESG risks within an investment, and to ensure we are aligned with our governance structure The framework consists of an overarching human rights and environmental protection policy and seven policies on sensitive sectors or issues: the defense industry; oil and gas (including oil sands); mining; dams; animal testing; forestry and logging; pulp & paper and oil palm; and nuclear weapons proliferation Each policy contains a number of predefined criteria and qualitative standards that may lead to the exclusion of a company or a country from our investment scope Swiss Res Asset Management unit applies these criteria to the vast majority of our investment assets, by excluding companies and countries if they do not meet the pre-defined criteria and qualitative standards

Criteria based on the Sustainability Risk Framework  as outlined above - are incorporated and applied to a vast majority of our investments On the environmental side, we source information on a country's environmental stress as well as protection policy from a number of intelligence providers and use that information to compose our own environmental risk rating 

Last year, we applied an internally developed model to assess our listed equity and bond holdings on sector-driven carbon intensity

At the end of 2015, more than 40% of our investment portfolio was managed externally For more systematic and regular monitoring of the actual integration of ESG factors into this portfolio, we have engaged the services of a leading ESG research company This expert provides in-depth research, ratings and analysis of the environmental, social and governance-related business practices They assess our portfolios relative to traditional as well as tailored ESG benchmarks built up on the following criteria: 
	Environmental: Climate Change, Natural Resources Use, Waste Management and Environmental Opportunities;
	Social: Human Capital, Product Safety, Social Opportunities;
	Governance: Corporate Governance, Business Ethics, Government & Public Policy

Results are used to better understand the implications of incorporating ESG considerations into our investment decision-making process and to further improve the quality of our investment portfolio For that, we work closely with the external managers to ensure they consider these ESG aspects in their investment processes The managers individual performances are monitored in line with our Responsible Investment Policy, and they are required to report regularly on their responsible investment activities  The next step is to provide a deep-dive analysis on the portfolio's inherent carbon emissions to get detailed transparency and to better manage the risks and opportunities associated with climate change 

Furthermore, we actively contribute to a low carbon economy by investing in the growing SSA (sovereigns, supranationals and agencies) green bond market, primarily relying on the Green Bond Principles Moreover, as part of our commitment to sustainability, we invest in green bonds in our credit mandates, as well as renewables and social infrastructure in our infrastructure private debt mandates

In Swiss Re's real estate investments, sustainability criteria play an essential role Swiss Re's Energy Mission Statement describes strict sustainability guidelines for investment as well as own used properties  It sets standards for new constructions and refurbishment, eg MINERGIE standard (wwwminergiech) a Swiss Quality label specifying high levels of energy efficiency and superior user comfort

Erie Family Life Insurance Company," Climate change lends greater uncertainty to the frequency and severity of storm-related catastrophes, and makes catastrophe related underwriting experience less predictable

Also, due to the uncertain impact and future of climate change, catastrophe risk models used for risk estimation and pricing may not appropriately depict risk This modeling limitation may further contribute to inadequacy of rates and premiums charged

ERIE also depends on reinsurers to support its catastrophe response and liquidity posture These reinsurers may have weaker or stronger opinions about the influence of climate change on their portfolio of catastrophe risk As such, ERIE may experience changes to the cost and availability of reinsurance over time",3
American Family Home," Therefore Munich Re Group operates separate departments which conduct research & development in crucial areas of environmental relevance in order to offer technical solutions to reduce the environ-mental impact/risk of industrial production processes Moreover, Munich Re's Board of Management appointed a Reputation Risk Committee for reinsurance Its core function is to advise the operative units on sensitive business decisions on the basis of ecological, social and corporate governance as-pects
For example with regard to Reinsurance, the divisional units have several innovative teams in place that are interdisciplinary groups made up of highly qualified experts who work together with specialists from the underwriting units to develop new business opportunities Furthermore, a key role for product development is also played in more than 20 centers of competency with their wide range of specialist areas, eg environmental liability risks One of them, the Corporate Climate Centre, has overall re-sponsibility in the field of Climate Change  concentrated since May 2007 These centers make their knowledge available to underwriters and clients around the world In many cases the Corporate Re-sponsibility Department, the Corporate Climate Centre and the GeoRisks department provide their consultancy service though the mentioned channels For instance, the data available through NatCatService assists underwriters in talks with clients Liability & Insurance Department are respon-sible for long term risks, risks of change, man-made disasters; fundamental issues of liability and in-surance law and social influences on liability and insurance Especially climate change-related liability is a rapidly evolving topic In the United States claims aimed at securing compensation for damage al-legedly resulting from greenhouse gas emissions have mushroomed in recent years While damages claims based on greenhouse gas emissions have only a very low probability to succeed in the courts, we may see successful climate change related claims based on non-compliance with regulation or professional duties in the future Apart from that, insured defence costs can be significant irrespective of litigation outcomes The publication Liability for climate change?underlines Munich Res commit-ment to monitor and respond to such developments and to offer clients appropriate support
To share knowledge of scientific data and findings with its clients Munich Re developed the NATHAN Risk Suite, a service for identifying and assessing complex natural hazard risks containing scientific and insurance-related information including individual-risk or portfolio analysis For example, NATHAN enables new accumulation risks arising from a rapid increase in new technologies (eg renewable en-ergies) to be analyzed faster and more accurately
Munich Re Group is active in the development of new risk transfer solutions in respect to a low carbon economy Renewable energies for example are a dynamic growth sector, with increasing business po-tential for insurance as well Munich Re offers a number of solutions that promote the use of these new technologies We develop innovative enterprise risk solutions such as lack of sun, lack of wind and warranty cover for solar and wind In addition, we provide a comprehensive range of insurance solutions along the whole value chain of the renewable-energy sector and across the entire life cycle of renewable-energy projects
In addition, Munich Re publishes specific magazines for its clients often also highlighting sustainability and/or environmental aspects Furthermore customers are provided the opportunity to talk to its ex-perts; symposia, fairs, are amongst the platforms
Furthermore, with regard to marine insurance business, Munich Re provides early warning of burning issues to the marine insurance industry by making the results of research and insights available to its clients

Garrison Property and Casualty Insurance,"  This is ultimately used as part of determining our risk profile and adjusting exposures accordingly  Enterprise Capital and Liquidity requirements are based in part on these catastrophe models The following categories have been identified as significant risks for USAA: 

(1)	Hurricanes represent USAAs largest catastrophe risk exposure  Various hurricane models and research suggest that storm intensity may increase due to changing weather patterns, leading to higher societal costs  This is exacerbated when combined with increasing property values and population growth in catastrophe-prone areas USAA is committed to preserving its financial strength over the long-term, and we take the uncertainties surrounding natural catastrophes into consideration when setting conservative capital requirements For example, USAAs capital requirements are more conservative than levels set by regulatory and rating agencies As a result, the company is prepared to withstand a 1-in-1,000 year catastrophe event and maintains a much more conservative premium-to-surplus ratio than standards set by regulators or rating agencies 

(2)	Storm Surge and Flood - scientific research has demonstrated a rise in global sea levels, increasing the impacts of storm surge USAAs current exposure to storm surge risk is greatly mitigated through the use of coastal underwriting requirements  Areas with high storm surge exposures are only written when members meet exceptional requirements, such as an Institute for Business and Home Safety (IBHS) fortified home Flood risk represents less than 1% of USAAs catastrophe exposure  the majority of which corresponds to renters and automobiles (the federal government provides coverage for homeowners and other property products through the National Flood Insurance Program) 

(3)	Wildfires - Due to the effects of drought, untamed vegetation, and land development, wildfires have been increasing in terms of frequency and severity  Wildfire exposure continues to grow in the United States, and USAA is working on more robust wildfire risk assessment, including modeling capabilities In addition, prevention efforts are being expanded to further protect our members For example, USAA provides members with access to multiple programs and services to help them mitigate wildfire-related property loss We offer many members in high-risk wildfire areas: 

	Wildfire Response Program: One of the great benefits we offer to our members in 14 states most susceptible to wildfires is a wildfire response program through Wildfire Defense Systems (WDS) Members in those states who have a USAA homeowners or rental insurance policy can enroll in the program at no additional cost WDS monitors wildfire activity and takes proactive mitigation measures to help protect a USAA members property when an active wildfire looms nearby In the program, WDS uses certified wild land firefighters to safely go behind fire lines (with permission from the Incident Commander) to assess potential risk and assist with mitigation efforts WDS can go into an evacuation zone and to member homes before a fire reaches them and take measures to help prevent a loss (reinforcing mitigations actions members should also do, such as closing windows and garage doors, moving wood piles away from the homes, clearing debris from under wood decks, clearing gutters, and removing debris from rooftops) After the fire sweeps through the area, WDS may go back to member homes and make sure no spot fires are smoldering that still could cause damage 

	USAAs Property Risk Assessment Tool: Too often, homebuyers purchase a property only to learn later that it is in an area prone to natural disasters USAAs Property Risk Assessment Tool helps members eliminate those unpleasant surprises The online tool enables members to plug in the address of any US home and get information about the propertys general exposure to various natural disasters, such as wildfire and flood It also offers tips on how to reduce the likelihood or impact of loss

	Firewise Communities: USAA actively supports the development of recognized Firewise Communities, which decrease the risk of losses due to wildfires USAA is the only major national insurance carrier to offer a discount for communities who are recognized with the NFPA Firewise designation  USAA also actively partners with many state and local government agencies to promote Firewise principles and help communities learn best practices in taking steps towards living in harmony with the local fire ecology that prevails in their geographic location  USAA also actively supports research to determine what factors most influence social behavior to motivate communities to choose to become Firewise

	WDSpro app: WDSpro is a free mobile app available for members who reside in pre-selected single family homes in/near high wildfire risk areas and are insured with USAA It empowers members to capture key information about their property along with photos of their homes exterior and surroundings and send this information to experts for a wildfire risk assessment The risk assessment provides step-by-step advice on actions they can take to minimize fire risks The information members provide in the app will not affect their insurance policy or premiums

--Management Method: We manage this risk through our Business Continuity Planning program, which addresses data recovery, continuation of business functions and the use of supporting technology to recover critical business operations in the event of unexpected disruptions The plans are updated and documented annually   Data center recovery plans, with the objective to fully recover all critical applications, are tested routinely with end-user evaluations of the restored systems as part of the testing protocol  Cignas critical applications run in hardened sites protected by an emergency generator Weve also repatriated core elements of our recovery capability from contracted third party services including infrastructure to recover the top prioritized business functions and related computer applications through data and server replication  To support clients, we have an online Disaster Resource Center, which is updated to offer resources specific to an area and incident Balancing urgency with high-level problem solving, our Employee Assistance Consultant (EAC) team is trained to quickly work through variables to determine the appropriate level of response On-the-spot creativity, paired with an intimate knowledge of the provider network, allows EACs to meet client needs in a time of chaos and confusion   As part of supplier selection, we engage in a full business review, which considers potential physical risks, and we obtain insurance to mitigate physical risks

Reputation: Corporate reputation on performance related to environmental responsibility, particularly on issues related to climate change, is increasingly important to our corporate clients as evidenced by the frequent occurrence of sustainability questions on RFPs for potential corporate clients and RFIs from existing ones Also, our reputation on performance related to climate change issues may become increasingly important to our employees, investors and other stakeholders We will continue to monitor their key concerns and areas of greatest interest through stakeholder materiality assessments

--Management Method: We manage our reputation concerns related to climate change through our Strategic Sustainability Performance Plan, continued emission reductions investments to support this plan, and associated reduction targets Also, the advancement of our Cigna Connects corporate responsibility framework across our organization supports these efforts by aligning and communicating our Corporate Responsibility initiatives We also closely monitor corporate client and investor requests related to climate change and corporate responsibility  Additionally, our Corporate Real Estate Group aligns site-level environmental, energy, and real property planning systems to elevate sustainability in site management We also engage stakeholders and employees to enhance continuous improvement in the implementation of sustainability This includes gathering data and operational experience from programs and sites, disseminating internal scorecards that provide feedback on progress towards goals and completing mandatory and voluntary external reports",3

Aetna Inc discusses its Corporate Responsibility and environmental initiatives and record in its report, 2014 Aetna Story  The following is an excerpt from the 2014 Aetna Story: http://wwwaetnastorycom/downloads/AetnaStory2014_CorporateResponsibilitypdf 
Environmental Sustainability: As a leader in social responsibility, we are employing innovation and determination to move the sustainability needle We optimized our energy performance and reduced our energy consumption across the Aetna-owned portfolio of facilities in 2012 and 2013, excluding the Coventry Health Care properties we acquired last year We saved more than 178 million kilowatt hours across the enterprise from 2011 to 2013  a 156 percent reduction over 2 years

The lynchpin of this effort is our Sustainable Data Center and Technology initiative Recognized by the Computerworld Honors Program in 2013 for using information technology to promote positive social and economic change, our green data center project enables 20 percent greater operating efficiency  adding at least a decade of life to our data centers

We also continue to invest in renewable energy, virtually doubling our annual production of electricity in 2013 to 465,000 kwh with the addition of solar panels to a second Aetna-owned facility

Building on our foundational strengths, we will continue to help improve the quality of life for the American s and people across the globe for a more sustainable future 

Aetna has created a page on wwwaetnacom to describe its corporate responsibility efforts  In 2009, Aetna also created a web page on its Aetnacom site to provide additional information to constituents about the companys commitment to sustainability The web address of this page is: http://wwwaetnacom/about-us/corporate-responsibility/aetnas-commitment-healthy-environmenthtml

Stillwater Ins. Cp.,"com  Our agent-facing FIRST platform enables on-line quoting, policy issuance, endorsements, servicing, billing and remittance for all independent agents/business partners  
The second of our web-based platforms, launched in April 2013, enables policyholders to make payments and elect paperless delivery of their policy documents, ie; the policy booklet, declaration pages and endorsements (formerly called pDocs)  In the six years since this self-service platform was launched, usage has grown significantly  As of 12/31/18, approximately 139,000 policyholders have adopted self-service to make payments (up 17% from the 119,000 users reported in last years response) and approximately 21,000 of those have elected paperless delivery of their policy documents (up 27% from the 16,600 reported in last years response)  While the number of policyholders electing paperless delivery of documents continues to grow rapidly, the greater impact is that 95% of our independent agents/business partners, who generate virtually all our written premium, utilize a business version of paperless
A more recent development is our eDocs initiative in response to 24 states eliminating the requirement for generic policy statements to be mailed and instead allowing them to be posted on a public-facing website  The eDocs program was piloted in two states in January 2019 and then launched in all 24 states that currently allow it in March 2019  As a result of this initiative, the Company saves an average of 47,000 sheets of paper per week which amounts to over 530,000 sheets of paper since March 2019  The use of eDocs also reduces the throughput on our high-speed Xerox printers and Pitney-Bowes inserter thereby reducing energy use as well as the use of toner and other associated consumables 

In summary, the two self-service platforms and the eDocs initiative enable the Company to:
(a) reduce the environmental impact of the use of consumables, 
(b) maximize the productivity of its Customer Service Representatives, 
(c) better control the size of its physical footprint and related environmental impact and
(d) more effectively manage its costs in all of these areas

Agri General Insurance  Company," Chubb invests to continually upgrade and refine its risk management tools Chubb accounts for the potential impact of climate risks on the companys own facilities and operations Chubbs risk analysis ranges from the known (based on definitive historical loss experience) to the hypothetical (based on a probable maximum loss (PML) calculation) Through the use of catastrophe models, Chubb manages severe weather risk to indirect client exposures throughout the world Special emphasis is given to areas where Chubb has significant exposures and the inherent risk from extreme weather events  such as tropical cyclone and other windstorm  is deemed to be high, such as the coastal United States, Southeast Asia and UK/Europe To aid in prioritizing management focus on extreme weather events, each peril region is classified as either Tier 1, 2 or 3 according to the exposures and risk combination present Tier 1 regions are the highest-priority areas for the company as they present the greatest risk profile and are the most carefully managed Tier 2 and 3 regions are also closely managed at the regional and business unit level In addition to modeled peril regions, we focus on non-modelled perils, such as flood, which present a risk in many of the developing areas of the Chubb insurance portfolio We are presently actively developing in-house tools to identify and track our exposures related to flood, given an increasing incidence in flood losses in our property insurance portfolio over the last decade

To ensure that its enterprise risk management (ERM) efforts are focused in terms of time horizon and business materiality, Chubb's ERM discipline is defined as the process to identify, assess, mitigate and monitor those risks that, if manifested, mainly over the next 36 months, might impact Chubbs exposure footprint (investments, operations and short/long-tail liabilities) such that the firms ability to achieve its strategic business objectives might be impaired For that ERM mission statement, 36 months is defined as the period during which Chubb conducts its strategic ERM planning but actual ERM execution, and risks associated with that execution, has a 1-2 year focus Thus, our scenario analyses are modeled on a yearly basis to inform daily underwriting Because we generally underwrite one-year contracts, the stochastic modeling assumes current climate conditions However, we also perform portfolio analysis with a 30-year timeframe to better inform management of the overall book of business, with the expectation that conditions will change over time Further, we have stress tested several of our key climate-peril models, such as US hurricane, against IPCC scenarios to understand potential impacts	

The results of our scenario analyses inform our business strategy on an ongoing basis, both in terms of making underwriting decisions on specific accounts and in terms of managing entire lines of business For example, our modeling of flood risk has improved to the extent that our specialized understanding of the risk enabled us to expand Chubbs primary flood insurance coverage offering for consumers and businesses

Professional Insurance Company," 

As a general comment, analysts do not expect that the life insurance industry will be particularly subject to the physical aspects of climate change Of course, extreme weather events and the range of other physical impacts of climate change have the potential to affect our real estate investments and our leased facilities and we maintain a comprehensive physical loss insurance program to mitigate such risk

To the extent that climate change results in increased regulation we will comply with such changed regulation as it applies to our investment portfolio Beyond that, we believe that climate change regulation generally will create investment opportunities for us in energy efficiency and renewable energy 

The Government of Canada has made a commitment to having 90 per cent of Canadas electricity provided by non-emitting sources such as hydro, nuclear, and wind power by 2020 In the United States, during President Obamas first term, the United States more than doubled generation of electricity from wind and solar energy; President Obama has set a goal to again double wind and solar generation by 2020 Sun Life is continuing to enhance its expertise in financing clean and renewable energy given the potential for growth and investment opportunities in this sector

We believe there are opportunities from an investment perspective in energy efficiency as it applies to real estate investments The LEED Green Building Rating System encourages and accelerates global adoption of sustainable building and development practices LEED is the nationally accepted benchmark for the design, construction and operation of high-performing green buildings We aspire to make LEED compliance part of our investment criteria and we have a number of real estate investments which have received, or are in the process of obtaining, LEED certifications 

We also participate in other industry programs which monitor the environmental profile of our buildings For example, Building Owners and Managers Association (BOMA) Building Environmental Standards (BESt) is the Canadian environmental program managed by BOMA The program recognizes excellence in environmental management and performance and under the program all buildings undergo a third party verification review before achieving any of the four levels of BOMA BESt certification A number of our real estate investments have received BOMA BESt certification

We believe the improved efficiency, tenant comfort and reduced environmental footprint of these real estate investments will make these investments a more attractive choice for environmentally aware tenants and will support their value well into the future

(Hereinafter referred to as the Companies)

Please note that the above list of companies have approximately 20% of their total writings in Property and the remaining 80% of their total writings are for lines other than property; thus the primary business focus is on liability lines of insurance Additionally the companies write almost entirely commercial lines risks rather than personal lines risks 

Berkley Life and Health Insurance Company (Berkley Life) writes health insurance and reinsurance in four primary areas: medical stop loss, managed care, special risk and group captive Historically we have not experienced any increase in losses as a result of natural catastrophes such as hurricane, flood or tornado, nor do we currently anticipate this to occur in the future Neither the management of Berkley Life nor the Berkley Group Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) team has identified any link between loss frequency and / or severity in these niche health insurance products written by Berkley Life and natural catastrophes such as hurricane, tornado, flood, drought or wildfire Consequently although Berkley Life has full access to the Berkley Groups research into the potential impact of climate change, it is not currently an issue for Berkley Life from an insured loss perspective 
Survey Question 1: Yes, the Companies do the following: 
 Recycling: Our Companies participate in programs that encourage the recycling of paper, bottles and cans, as well as cardboards and plastics, as well as ink cartridges Document destruction bins and a pick-up service are used by nearly all offices within the Group that allow for proper destruction of paper files This service picks up, shreds, and recycles the paper in those destruction bins so that trees are preserved within the environment 
Additionally, some offices have drop off bins for employees wishing to donate things such as eyeglasses, batteries, and old cell phones Those companies then donate those items to organizations that are able to re-use the recycled items Office supplies are recycled by one company and then donated to an organization that provides low cost/free supplies to teachers who have a need for classroom items Several office locations recycle used computer equipment when possible and/or refurbish and donate equipment in working condition to local charitable organizations that are in need of computer equipment 
The Companies continually strive to promote a greener environment by converting to paperless as much as possible and imaging paper files into electronic documents More frequently, offices are beginning to remind email recipients under the signature line of their email to consider the environment before printing to conserve paper One office has placed codes on internal printers to monitor and discourage unnecessary printing and ensure that when printing is required, its being done in the most efficient format and to the most efficient printer for a given print job 
Email and phone communication, both with internal and external customers (namely policyholders) is encouraged to reduce the Companies carbon footprint and cut down on printed hard copy communications One example of this conservation of paper to protect the environment is the setting up of claims electronically via telephone or email Another office is converting the delivery of marketing materials to electronic format rather than in paper format In most offices, whiteboards and digital projectors are installed in meeting rooms so that the amount of paper consumed is reduced when meetings are held 
One example of the Companies demonstrating their care for the environment occurred when their office building was under construction Instead of purchasing brand new fixtures and furnishings, they reused some materials such as doors, window treatments, light fixtures and ceiling grid from the previous building to save on cost and to reduce the amount of waste that they were putting in the landfill As far as cleaning materials for our offices buildings are concerned, the selection of cleaning materials within some of the locations is carefully considered and a large portion of the cleaning products used in certain offices are either environmentally safe cleaning products and/or are white vinegar based 

 Water & Conservation: Companies closely monitor outdoor irrigation, some to an extent that sensors determine whether or not the grounds actually need water based on the amount of rainfall that the area has seen Others are set on timers and only run during specific, set times to provide for a more predictable monthly water bill In addition, the setting of timers to determine watering schedule allows for the building grounds to be watered with optimum efficiency, thereby reducing over-watering Internally, certain buildings have a reverse osmosis system installed that provides filtered water to employees and is intended to promote the use of thermos/hard plastic water bottles and cut down on the amount of trash/recycling One of the Companies has low consumption water closets installed in all of the bathrooms to further reduce the amount of water used

 Lighting: Some Company buildings are currently in process of or already are Energy Star Rated Some have converted incandescent lighting to fluorescent, low energy lighting Lighting of buildings at most office locations is set for regularly scheduled business hours and is of limited use on nights and weekends In addition, employees are encouraged to turn lights off in areas not in use and reminders are placed in those areas to encourage employees to conserve energy when possible In some offices, motion activated sensors have been installed for lighting so that energy is automatically conserved when an area is not being used Externally, parking garage lighting is also set on a timer schedule and only provides lighting during scheduled hours of the day, rather than continuously

 Heating and Cooling: Companies monitor usage of heating and cooling systems and many set heat pumps back at night and during non-business hours to conserve energy usage when employees are not there When employees are in the building, heat and cooling system temperatures are closely monitored using a computerized environment with limited access, and systems run only when necessary rather than continuously On nights and weekends, heating and cooling can be limited to areas where an employee is based and is on a timer scheduled system Having areas on a timer system eliminates the need to heat or cool an entire building for an individual during non-standard business hours 
Regular, scheduled preventative maintenance is done on heating and cooling systems to ensure optimum efficiency and cut down on any possible wasted energy (this includes regular changing of air filters, etc) Additionally, one of the Companies has 2 HVAC chiller systems that are environmentally friendly and operate during the summer months to cut down on humidity within the building and aid in keeping the energy exertion of the air conditioning to a lower level Some offices either have or are in the process of replacing older heat pumps with newer, more energy efficient units to further reduce energy consumption 

 Technology: Company intranet pages and emails are encouraged as a main source of communication iPads are available to some employees at a few of the offices that help to minimize the need to print reports and materials for meetings with internal and external customers Additionally, the use of social media sites (Twitter and LinkedIn) provides an opportunity to communicate information electronically without the need for printing hard copies IT, at one location, is in process of enhancing their technology by converting computer monitors from LCD to LED and replacing older computer systems with more up to date, energy efficient models In addition, at one location plans are in place to convert the server room to a more energy efficient area that would promote less usage of cooling systems Other companies within the Group share an office location and a data center that allows for them to consolidate the amount of energy and resources used 

Increasingly offices are installing power shut offs on all desk computer systems to further save on energy during non-standard business hours and weekends Some employees have the capability to access the office remotely to curtail transportation to and from the office Video/web conferencing is also becoming more common amongst offices to reduce the frequency of travel, but still allow individuals to meet on work-related topics as required 

 Transportation: Carpooling has been adopted by a number of the offices as a means to cut down on the number of cars on the road and reduce emissions released by vehicles To promote use of public transit to get to and from work, one office offers an employer sponsored public transit pass system to encourage continued use of public transportation A particular office has a designated bicycle storage facility within their office building to promote the use of greener means of transportation to and from work, whether that be biking to work or using public transportation and then biking to the office

An example of a company incentivizing employees to reduce their carbon footprint is through a Trip Reduction Program that rewards employees who carpool the majority of each work week Those employees, in turn, get placed into a drawing for a monthly prize amongst the members that participate in the program

Telecommuting is available to some departments and office locations The ability to work from home allows for individuals to remote in and work from their home, to save fuel costs, reduce the number of cars on the road and also cut down on the emissions released into the air by vehicles As another means of reducing emissions and fuel costs, a few of the office locations have company cars that are either hybrid and/or get 30+ mpg A second method of cutting down on daily commutes is achieved by offices positioning themselves or relocating to areas where most staff can easily use public transport to get to work, rather than driving personal vehicles 
Other Companies within the Berkley organization are also beginning to open up satellite office(s) that allow Berkley employees located in nearby vicinities to share an office space and also cut down travel time significantly for employees who may live closer to the satellite office than to the home office of the company for which they are employed An alternative thats offered by some companies is allowing employees to work flexible hours so that employees may avoid commuting during high traffic times to and from work",0

"Arcadian Health Plan, Inc.","  Customers, shareholders, members of the public, and employees all have access to Humanas disclosures through CDP, the Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI), and other voluntary CSR communications

Humana also sees our value chain as key constituencies and an extension of our business We engage with suppliers to assess how partnerships can drive collective impact in the areas of sustainability and efficiency Such initiatives have focused on sustainable procurement and increasing waste diversion throughout our supply chain 

Our third release of the Supplier Self-Assessment Sustainability Scorecard engaged more suppliers than the previous year  Responses were facilitated by our availability for one-on-one engagement Via the Scorecard, we collect information from key suppliers regarding their efforts to reduce the environmental impacts associated with their vendor engagement with Humana  This initiative helped us understand the environmental impact of our vendor relationships and set the stage for more robust data collection; findings are reported in our CSR report updates, internal scorecard, and to Humana leadership  We aim to expand this initiative in the future by engaging suppliers that represent the greatest impact As our supply chain program evolves, implementation of the supplier scorecard process will be evaluated on its ability to support our efforts in meeting CDP expectations, assist with sourcing decisions, mitigate risk, and be used as a tracking tool for business reviews  We have strengthened our approach by initiating information requests for larger suppliers during the contract renewal or new vendor engagement process; this underscores our intention to maintain this practice for these suppliers on an annual basis

After setting new emissions reduction and waste diversion targets to ensure continued improvement in 2018 and beyond, we engaged a new facilities management vendor with formalized expectations of their collaborative requirements to ensure attainment of our new targets These expectations were included in the RFP when soliciting bids in an effort to elevate our sustainability progress; responding vendors then provided their expertise and recommendations to help us achieve our sustainability targets, which informed our final decision-making  

We also proactively work to connect our suppliers and associates to identify opportunities to collaborate and improve our environmental sustainability For example, several suppliers presented at multiple sustainability fairs held at Humana in 2016 and 2017, allowing associates to understand how the procured services address sustainability During our Inclusion & Diversity Day, associates were encouraged to provide feedback on supplier sustainability efforts

Finally, as part of our Bold Goal initiative  an effort to improve the health of the communities we serve 20% by 2020  Humana has engaged with partners to identify social determinants of health like the environmental triggers of asthma, widely acknowledged to be exacerbated by changes in climate and reduced air quality We partner with AIR Louisville using technology, data analytics, and community collaboration to better understand the environmental triggers of asthma that afflicts almost 13% of the population in the city where we are headquartered The intention of this program is to identify the causes of asthma, which will then help our city leaders make smarter decisions about air quality The Bold Goal initiative is a notable example of how Humana responds to the intersection of environmental health and well-being

CompBenefits Company,"  Our overall enterprise risk management framework requires risk owners to present segment-specific risk and solvency assessments to the audit committee of the board, which may encompass climate change related risks and opportunities  Financial scenario analyses are then conducted to determine priority

Humana conducts Materiality Assessments of key themes and impact areas to determine environmental risks and opportunities that have the most significant impact on its business and stakeholders  The evaluation process is conducted in accordance with GRI stakeholder engagement process recommendations, and references research by GRI and SASB about the most material topics for the healthcare industry Humana engages a wide population of internal stakeholders that included senior managers, in order to prioritize risks and opportunities and comprehensively address external stakeholder concerns, such as financial performance and customer perception

Core issues evaluated during Humanas second biennial materiality assessment, conducted in autumn 2015, included, among other topics: energy consumption and emissions associated with our data centers and facilities; office and medical waste management; supply chain greenhouse gas emissions; and employee commute impacts  Once identified internally, these topics were scored against indicators evaluating environmental and social impacts as well as civil society & NGO priorities to develop a final ranking

Based on the rankings of these indicators, Humana determined new priorities and aligned existing initiatives into a living roadmap that will be used to guide Humanas future sustainability policies and initiatives


Climate Change Impact on Market Demand
Changes in temperature and weather patterns across the US and the world have the ability to influence disease vectors and the spread of infectious diseases as well as the frequency and the severity of chronic illnesses  If this were to happen, it could lead to increased incidences of chronic illnesses and in the type of clinical services Humana will need to offer its members For example, ""The Impacts of Climate Change on Human Health in the United States: A Scientific Assessment"" published by the US Global Change Research Program notes that climate change is already resulting in significant public health impacts which will continue to worsen if greenhouse gas emissions are not addressed

If Humana did not prepare for changes in physical climate, it is possible that Humana could suffer a loss in market share due to lack of readiness as well as increased operational costs associated with more health-related claims being filed   It is difficult to assess the financial impacts of these risks given the complexity of climate change and population health, however we do not currently anticipate substantial bottom line impacts

Senior level management will review pertinent information and have the ultimate authority to recommend changes in services offered and cost structures related to shifts in claims filed, or other company procedures in order to reduce impacts from these changes in customer claims and health trends related to changes in climate  The results of our partner dialogues and regional trending will inform future decisions around services offered to mitigate these impacts

"Technology Insurance Company, Inc."," 
We have performed an internally developed analysis of our investment portfolio to determine our concentration in fossil fuel investments Our fossil fuel investments comprise less than 5% of our overall group-wide investment portfolio Our fossil fuel investments are mostly in the oil and gas sector and some in the utility sector Our portfolio consists of readily marketable investment grade fixed income securities with relatively short duration As such our climate change risk is considered low, due to the risk taking place over much longer time horizons The corporate bonds portfolio is well diversified by sector and issuer and the impact of climate change, if any, on the creditworthiness of any issuer is insignificant in the context of the whole portfolio 

The company has altered its investment strategy in response to these considerations - Please summarize steps you have taken 
We are mindful of our exposure to fossil fuel investments and have attempted to keep our exposure to such investments at a very small percentage of our overall portfolio We believe climate risk is a consideration tempered by a relatively short duration portfolio which would allow us to react quickly to any effects of climate risk should they begin to emerge",4

State Auto Property and Casualty Insurance Company,"  Certain terms, conditions and premiums are aligned with risk-reducing behavior  For example, policyholders are encouraged to mitigate risk through various loss control measures and actions such as installing hurricane proof shutters to protect against wind losses, sprinkler systems to protect against fire and updated systems and roofs that protect homes and commercial buildings in severe weather  For personal property, the company provides a credit for Type 4 roofs which are hail resistant  Encouraging and crediting these types of roofs with longer life expectancies result in less roof damage losses and less material being placed in landfills  In a number of cases, the company offers a cosmetic roof endorsement so roofs which are cosmetically damaged, but still functional, can receive a settlement without replacing the roof  The company provides favorable rating on personal and commercial autos which have fewer annual miles or are driven on a less frequent basis or a shorter mile radius  This encourages responsible driving and reduces auto emissions  State Auto  utilizes  usage-based driving  (telematics) for some of our personal and commercial auto policyholders

Through State Auto labs, a team that focuses on emerging technology, we have been able to introduce additional digital products to help our policyholders mitigate risk Sensors have been installed in some personal and commercial lines risks to help determine when water leaks are taking place Early detection minimizes loss potential Sensors are helping some of our restaurant risks manage their product liability exposure by notifying them when temperatures in refrigeration equipment drop below acceptable levels This allows for advanced notice prior to food spoilage taking place or the serving of a damaged product   

State Auto provides technical bulletins and other information for agents or policyholders that address tornado and hurricane safety, fire safety, etc  Such information has relevance to climate change-related events Please see additional information regarding our communication with agents and policyholders in the response to Survey Question 7

"Beazley Insurance Company, Inc"," (BICI), is a Connecticut domiciled property and casualty insurer, and is a member of Beazley plc (the Group), an international specialist insurer with its headquarters in London, UK  Due to the global nature of climate change, the Group has taken positions in many areas that are applicable to all of its member companies including BICI  Where appropriate, we will draw distinctions between Group level actions and action taken by BICI

Yes, the Group actively looks for ways to mitigate emissions in its operations  The Groups activities are based primarily in the UK and the USA  As an insurance company located within leased buildings with shared tenancy, the Groups direct environmental impacts are relatively limited, as is its ability to influence the management of the buildings as a whole The Group has, however, monitored a range of corporate environmental metrics, and calculated annual corporate GHG emissions for its principal UK office since 2008 and for its larger US offices since 2009  Those are currently Farmington, New York and Chicago and Atlanta

The key sources of emissions from the Groups US/UK offices are business travel by air and imported electricity  The imported electricity is a building management controlled service so we are unable to alter this  In addition, for business travel we seek to downgrade our flights where possible which reduce our emissions and have introduced video conferencing globally

The Group places an emphasis on reducing emissions and waste in the areas of procurement, facilities, employee transit and through participation in building initiatives

Procurement:
	When we go out to tender, we build questions into our RFPs pertaining to the suppliers environmental sustainability program
	We have current vendors supply us with sustainability reports to track various metrics (energy saved, trees saved, etc)
Examples: 
	Total Office Supply saved 117,437 lbs of wood resources for 2017
	Total Office Supply saved 34,94489 lbs of greenhouse emissions in 2017
	Staples  41% of paper have advance eco features with 8% of basic eco features

Facilities:
	Recycling:
We participate in building recycling programs as available at each location separating Waste, Plastic, Paper, Batteries, Toner, etc as specified in each location
	This year we have made an effort to gear up our recycling in all US offices, including recycling K-cups where possible; buying compostable (instead of plastic) utensils where necessary; buying wooden (not plastic) coffee stirrers
	Note that in most US offices we have eliminated buying paper cups, opting instead for mugs and glasses, unless there is a specific need otherwise
	Each US office has a loaning library set up to donate or take used books
	Most US printers are set to print in two sided format
	Office build-outs/fit-outs  we analyze sustainability and recyclability of products such as furniture, countertops, etc
	Furniture  US workstations are comprised of 54% recycled materials, and are up to 69% recyclable at the end of their useful life
	Task chairs  US task chairs (dependent on the type) are comprised of 46% to 53% recyclable material, and they are 54% to 94% recyclable at the end of their useful life 
	Transitioning to all eco-friendly products for cleaning products in all offices
Examples:
	Chairs on 2nd Floor of our London office are 85% post-recyclable at the end of their useful life
	Install LED and other energy efficient lighting where feasible We replaced light fixtures in our Philadelphia office with LED, and are doing so in Farmington, CT this year We also replaced all LED perimeter lighting in our London office

Employee Transit:
	A commuter transportation reimbursement program is available to employees for using highway commuter transit vehicles or other forms of mass transit

Participation in Building Initiatives:
	In US, participate in building sponsored green equipment waste disposal days
	Book Exchange  the London building operates a loaning library in lobby reception (donate a book or take a book)  In the US, we set up loaning libraries in each office
	Eyeglass Donation  employees can give old spectacles to lobby receptionists in the London office; London building management collects and donates them to Vision Aid Overseas

Jefferson Natl Life Ins Co of NY," NWIs primary responsibility is to adhere to the investment and compliance policies established by its clients In accordance with the investment policies of the clients, NWI has a duty to assess the risks and opportunities of potential and current investments, which include those arising from climate change Therefore, NWIs credit research team considers both climate change and environmental regulations and disclosures along with many other factors in its assessment of the business risks and opportunities of all current and potential investments NWI also considers the effects of legislative action at the portfolio level when allocating funds across asset classes The potential long-term effects of climate change are considered in a number of ways across the asset classes where NWI actively invests on behalf of its clients
Some examples:
	For real estate/commercial mortgage loan investments, the potential impact of climate change factors into the evaluation/underwriting process by considering proximity to coastal areas and increased risk of tropical storm damage
	For municipal bond investments, the ability of the bond issues (ie municipality) to repay debt is largely influenced by the health of its local economy and stability of its population (tax) base Climate-change issues ranging from water scarcity in the Southwest to coastal migration in Florida are considered when evaluating potential investments
	For corporate bond and equity investments, we review a companys policy and practice to manage climate change and environmental risks in order to assess their potential impact on overall credit worthiness We also actively monitor industry sectors that are more sensitive to climate change and environmental risks
When assessing and managing all of these risks, we consider overall company financial exposure, including insured coverage, not just investment risk

Please note that the Companies have approximately 20% of their total writings in Property and the remaining 80% of their total writings are for lines other than property  Perils considered when assessing the potential risks posed by climate change include:
	Hurricane and tropical storm
	Tornado

	Drought
	Wildfire

Hurricane
North Atlantic hurricanes and tropical storms typically impact states between Texas and Maine  The Group identifies and models its hurricane risks in 23 states that could be affected by these perils, and on an annual basis has its exposures modeled in an alternative vendor model with a broader set of states

As noted in section 3, over the period from 1880 onwards there is a slight downward trend in the number of landfalling hurricanes  Some of the weather and climate conditions that make it easier for hurricanes to form in the Atlantic Basin also appear to impair the likelihood of landfall  For example, hurricanes that form further from land are less likely to maintain their structure long enough to make landfall as damaging events  As mentioned in section 3, Kutson et al proposed that in the long term global warming will cause potential shifts of hurricane activities towards less frequent and more severe events  However, the same science that provides this long term view also indicates it will be many decades before we see these changes  Also, other studies indicate that very different trends can be produced using different statistical relationships and temperature models

In a recent paper that discusses the short term (three to five years) impact of climate change on insured losses observes that climate change has had no measurable effect on the North Atlantic hurricanes that drive Cat Market losses Loss levels have gone up over time primarily due to increases in the value of building stock standing in the way of hurricanes These are the conclusions of the most recent report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change [Climate Change and Hurricane Loss: Perspectives for Investors by Karen Clark and John Lummis June 2015]
The IPCC note in their  CLIMATE CHANGE 2013 : The Physical Science Basis: Frequently Asked Questions that Over periods of a century or more, evidence suggests slight decreases in the frequency of tropical cyclones making landfall in the North Atlantic and the South Pacific, once uncertainties in observing methods have been considered 

The Group closely monitors the forecast numbers of tropical storms and hurricanes for each season, investigates all available vendor models, and tests alternative assumptions on the potential frequency and severity of such events

Each individual property location is assessed for catastrophe risk, with particular focus on those nearest the coast and / or near river estuaries  We do not typically provide flood coverage within FEMA flood zones; where flood coverage is provided in FEMA flood zones, only a modest limit is provided    

Tornado
As noted in section 3, over the period from 1950 onwards the number of tornadoes is not increasing  In older calendar years there was significant under-reporting of the weakest category of tornado (EF-0); if one considers all other tornado strengths there is no trend in the frequency of these events or in the number falling into each strength category EF-1 to EF-5

When tornado insured losses are normalized for changes in exposures (for example, the number and values of the buildings and contents, often in areas that were previously agricultural land), these too show no increasing trend

The Group models tornado losses in every state within the USA, and has also revalued the tornadoes reported by the ISO Property Claims Service (PCS) from 1950 onwards to allow for changes in exposure as an additional data source  

Flood
As noted in section 3, flood losses arising from river and surface water are decreasing as a percentage of GDP  
The majority of the property policies issued by the Group exclude losses covered by flood  In those policies that do cover flood, many have flood sublimits; where flood coverage is provided in FEMA flood zones, only a modest limit is provided 

Drought & Wildfire 
Drought and wildfire are strongly connected  One study looking at data through to 2002 indicated that fully half the variability in wildfire (measured by acres burned) arises as a result of drought conditions
(Fire and Drought, The Thoreau Institute, December 31, 2006) 

As noted in section 3, the current period of drought is not as severe as periods seen in the past  Furthermore, there was a drought in the latter part of the 16th century that was far more severe than any subsequent drought in North America 
During the last century, it is apparent that the El Nino / Southern Oscillation (ENSO) have a significant impact on the USA rainfall / drought conditions, in addition to which there appears to be an underlying modest upwards trend in the Severely to Extremely Dry acreage in the USA  

The Group does not write crop multi-peril business which could be significantly impacted by drought

"ProAssurance Indmenity Company, Inc.","   This question is not relevant to our business practice, operations or investment  The risks of climate change on the Company, as professional liability and incidental general liability insurers, have little or no effect on the occurrence of malpractice by doctors, dentists, allied health professionals, facilities or lawyers  Further, the impact on general liability claims for the professionals we insure is limited as well

The Companys underwriting risk is subject to repricing on an annual basis  To the extent that climate change were to impact general liability claims brought against the Companys insureds, that impact would likely take years to manifest itself, if at all  As such, any impact of climate change on general liability claims would be considered in both pricing and underwriting  We believe due to the nature of the risks written, the Companys exposure to climate change is minimal if at all and there is no need to address climate change in our risk management

As a professional liability and general liability insurer, climate change would not impact our decision to insure or not insure any particular risk

American Fire & Casualty Insurance Company,"  Through its efforts, Liberty Mutual has earned LEED certification for seven buildings and ENERGY STAR labels for eight buildings 
To meet the guidelines for these standards, the company applies a wide range of energy efficiency strategies including the addition of energy-efficient bulbs that use under one watt of energy per square foot, automatic flush toilets and automatic water spouts, lighting control systems that turn lights off after business hours in all common hallways, and occupancy sensors that control lights in offices and conference rooms  
Liberty Mutuals focus on energy reduction initiatives is ongoing and with a continued strong focus on implementing building operating best practices, the company continues to drive down its overall energy consumption across its owned building portfolio    
As it builds new and retro-fits existing buildings to LEED standards, Liberty Mutual mandates that all construction contractors on its work sites follow indoor air quality guidelines and practices  Examples include using recycled/recyclable carpet, low VOC (volatile organic compounds) adhesives, sealants, and paints  Liberty Mutuals new 22-story Boston office building was designed to be more energy efficient than a typical large modern office building and has achieved LEED Silver certification 
At the companys Dover, NH facility, Liberty Mutual replaced all of the 1,000-watt metal halide parking lot lights with 288-watt LEDs lights for a savings of 712 watts per fixture and a cost reduction of $458 per light  Overall, the LED lights have shown a 60 percent to 70 percent savings each month as compared to the old metal halides  Because of the success of the light replacement project in NH, Liberty Mutual recently installed 288-watt LED lights in its Weston office parking lot
In addition to an office furniture donation program, Liberty Mutual has also recently piloted two recycling programs for excess food in its Boston facility that it plans to roll-out to its Plano, TX and other facilities within the year  The programs are:
	Each week the company donates prepared food that was not served to Lovin Spoonfuls, which delivers the food directly to local homeless shelters and soup kitchens
	The Boston facility has a composter into which all unused food waste goes  The compost is then donated to a local farm where it is bagged and sold as fertilizer
	Old office furniture and supplies from the Boston, Weston and NH offices is donated to the Furniture Trust

As an insurance company Liberty Mutual produces large amounts of paperwork  Therefore, the companys Records Management department works closely with Liberty Mutuals record storage vendor to shred and recycle files eligible for destruction  Through its secure shredding program, in 2015 Liberty Mutual recycled 2,842 short tons of paper, which were transported to paper mills for pulping resulting in the following eco-friendly results: 4,115,467 pounds of CO2 avoided (the equivalent of 398 cars taken off the road), 47,692 trees saved, and approximately 14,211 cubic yards of landfill space conserved  
Liberty Mutual has also taken a leadership role in establishing compliance with office supply order minimums, which cuts down on emissions by reducing the number of deliveries required to service its account Further, Liberty Mutual purchases office supplies that are manufactured with an average of 37% post-consumer recycled content  These initiatives have saved 315,175 gallons of water, 692 trees, 65,451 pounds of CO2 and 62,106 kWh    
Liberty Mutuals PrintSmart Program has reduced printed paper by 32 million pages during 2015 which has conserved 33M gallons of water, saved 3,840 trees and reduced CO2 emissions by 455 tons
In 2015, 72% of all Liberty Mutual marketing collateral was printed on demand  with preferred printing partners or downloaded to a desktop  If users choose to print, systems route the order to the closest print facility based on the ship-to zip code, resulting in faster delivery and reduced freight travel distance, thereby, lowering carbon emissions  
Extending energy conservation beyond the office, over 98% of the companys automotive fleet consists of PZEV (partial zero emission vehicle) and flex-fuel vehicles  In 2015, the company reduced its fleet by 5%, reduced business miles driven by 4%, and transitioned 48% of its fleet from 6 to 4 cylinder vehicles  These changes to the vehicle program resulted in a positive impact of 23713 tons of CHG saved in the same period from 2014 to 2015 
Liberty Mutual has received numerous awards for its sustainability practices including: 
	2015 Champions of the Environment Award from the New York City College of Technology Foundation
	2014 Preservation Achievement Award from the Boston Preservation Alliance
	2012 Facility Management Achievement Award for Best Practices, Sustainability Award  from the International Facility Management Association (IFMA) Boston

Lifewise Assurance Company," While there are no Board or otherwise formally mandated/measured emissions reduction efforts at this time, Premera is currently working on a carbon footprint reduction/sustainability plan that will outline specific goals to further reduce our carbon footprint and become a more sustainable company We intend to have this plan completed by Q2, 2022 This will be a company-wide effort as opposed to just Real Estate & Facilities objectives



As part of our Campus Renewal project (rebuilding/remodeling our campuses in Mountlake Terrace (MLT) & Spokane through 2024), our new/remodeled buildings will have upgraded energy efficient HVAC systems, LED lighting, lighting controls, daylight harvesting, low flow restroom fixtures, EV charging stations, low VOC paint and furniture, native drought tolerant plants and smart irrigation systems In addition to these items, our newly completed building also used heavy timber construction (CO2 benefits) and has a green roof (complete in Q1, 2021) 

Across the MLT campus we utilize natural stormwater management with aeration pond & bioswales, limited use of pesticides, impervious pavement and the continued use of environmentally friendly cleaning products In addition, Premera has a ride reduction program that incentivizes employees to the use of mass transit, vanpooling and carpooling A new secure bike cage has been built to encourage employees to bicycle to work The Sound Transit light rail system is currently being constructed which will have a stop in Mountlake Terrace close to our campus  scheduled to be operational in 2024 We also have a recycling and composting program in all of our buildings to help minimize what is sent to the landfill

Premera has had roughly 1,100 employees working as permanent full-time telecommuters for many years In 2021, Premera converted a significant number of our roughly 1,850 full-time onsite employees, most of which work at Mountlake Terrace and Spokane, to telecommuters and hybrid (working from home 2 + days per week) employees These 1,850 employees are now permanently assigned to work as follows: 1,000 telecommuters, 765 hybrid and 85 full-time onsite employees This reduced the number of Premera employees commuting to campus every day by approximately 1,765 This has helped Premera to reduce our carbon footprint as well as increased employee productivity

Reliance Standard Life insurance Company,"S Tokio Marine Group Companies (Tokio Marine Group) are part of Tokio Marine Holdings, Incs  (TMH) worldwide initiative to become carbon neutral (net zero emissions) We have assessed carbon emissions, as measured by energy usage and paper consumption, since 2009 TMHs Mid-Term Business Plan for TMH and its subsidiaries entitled To be a Good Company 2017 includes the core theme of Protecting the Earth It has been acknowledged by senior management that the protection of the global environment is an important responsibility of all corporate entities in the Tokio Marine Group We are working as a group to create environmental value through constantly undertaking steps toward global environmental protection by providing products and services that are designed to mitigate or adapt to climate change, by realizing a reduction in our environmental footprint and becoming carbon neutral in our business operations, and by conducting global environmental protection activities 

TMH has established a dedicated Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Division that promotes environmental management throughout the Group In addition, key persons have been assigned to roles promoting CSR activities throughout the world Such activities include reducing environmental impact in business activities and efforts to protect the environment in local communities and society

A number of initiatives have been developed to achieve carbon neutral status including:
 Promoting Environmental Management Systems and employee participation through the 3Rs
(Reduce, Reuse, Recycle);
 The Green Gift Project which includes mangrove planting and other environmental protection activities worldwide which contribute not only to the alleviation of and adaptation to climate change and protection of biodiversity but also the reduction in disaster damage and stability in the lives of people in designated planting regions The Mangrove Planting Project has been in place since 1999 and since that time, in excess of 9,500 hectares of mangrove forest have been planted in nine countries: Indonesia, Thailand, The Philippines, Vietnam, Myanmar, Fiji, India, Bangladesh and Malaysia;
 PHLY 80K Trees, a tree planting program inspired by the Green Gift Project, which began in 2015 The PHLY 80K Trees goal was reached with the help of Philadelphia Insurance Companies (PIC) independent agents, brokers and policyholders and was renewed for the second year in 2016 PIC invited producers and policyholders to enroll in paperless statements The cost savings to PIC partially funded the planting of 80,000 trees Employees also raised money to support the initiative and in 2016, about 50 employees assisted with planting a portion of the 80,000 trees;
 GREENPHLY, a PIC employee-driven environmental awareness program which involves support of environmental protection activities by individuals and communities and efforts to reduce the environmental load in our offices through minimizing the environmental burden in our business activities

The Tokio Marine Group has adopted the following practices to assess and reduce or mitigate emissions in the organizations:  Going paperless and/or reducing paper consumption Many offices have switched to printer paper made from recycled content for use when printing is necessary  Purchasing office supplies that are made from green or recycled materials  Transitioning from water bottle coolers to more energy efficient, bottle-less water cooler systems and utilizing reusable bottles in place of plastic water bottles or styrofoam cups  Replacing personal printers with shared, more energy-efficient multifunctional devices  Redesigning workstations to reduce energy costs  Establishing recycling programs for paper, plastic, light bulbs, toner and ink cartridges and cans and bottles at offices nationwide Encouraging carpooling, vanpooling and other ride share options as well as the use of public transportation  Encouraging bike to work programs  Replacing face-to-face meetings by using video conference equipment, WebEx and other technologies  Participation in TMHs 100 year commitment to the re-forestation of the mangrove trees by having employees take part in planting mangrove trees on plantations in Southeast Asia  Becoming LEED certified in some locations  Utilizing timers on lights to reduce energy consumption The Tokio Marine Group has also taken steps to increase environmental education and awareness among its employees Community outreach events are regularly organized to demonstrate the Tokio Marine Groups commitment to reducing environmental impact Initiatives included:  Lunch-and-Learn Events:
Representatives from local environmental non-profits invited to speak to employees about areas of environmental concern such as storm water management, clean air and pollution and energy conservation  Employee Volunteer Events: A number of company-sponsored environmental volunteer events have been conducted Since 2012, the Tokio Marine Group has had an environmental corporate social responsibility coordinator on staff  PIC established GreenPHLY, a team effort by employees to preserve the environment and mitigate the carbon footprint PIC developed the GreenPHLY Environmental Priority Action Plan which established the companys environmental goals and objectives for the future The plan is focused on three (3) environmental priority areas including carbon footprint reduction, environmental education and awareness and community outreach In support of carbon footprint reduction, carbon emissions, as measured by energy usage and paper consumption, are tracked using the Hara environment management system software PIC has purchased green power equivalent to 100% of the companys electricity use in its offices nationwide since 2013 The purchase of certified, 100% wind generated renewable energy certificates in 2016 displaced 3,2404 metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions, which is equivalent to taking 684 cars off the road for a year

This green power purchase enabled PIC to join the EPAs Green Power Partnership (GPP) and Leadership Club The GPP assists organizations in procuring electricity generated from renewable sources and recognizes Partners green power leadership In 2014, PIC was awarded a US EPA Green Power Leadership Award for Green Power Purchasing In 2015, PIC launched a campaign in partnership with the Arbor Day Foundation to replant trees in forests nationwide that have been devastated by wildfires In 2015, PIC launched a campaign in partnership with the Arbor Day Foundation to replant trees in forests nationwide that have been devastated by wildfires Since 2015, PIC has funded the planting of 160,000 trees and has renewed this commitment for the 2017- 2018 planting season to plant an additional 80,000 trees

Environmental impact is factored in when making investment decisions For smaller insurance companies it is typically the case that third-party managers directly manage a large portion of the general account For the company, this is the case with our investment management approach While strategic and tactical asset allocation decisions are made on the portfolio by internal management, our investment manager helps inform those decisions
Our investment manager manages, and continues to manage the portfolio for a variety of reasons, one of which is their approach to ESG and climate change Some of the responses below provide more direct guidance into how climate change is managed directly by our investment manager

Outside of our investment managers mandate, the group attempts to diversify its exposure across the portfolio and factors in climate change as one of the existential threats to the risks in the portfolio For example, when evaluating real estate investments, particular focus is given to coastal properties that would be impacted by wind or shore erosion A majority of the direct energy exposure has been concentrated in the midstream sector Lastly, outside of our investment managers mandate, the group has promoted lending in the renewable energy sector by purchasing close to ~$40 million of USDA solar finance loans
These loans help finance the construction of rural solar development projects

Consideration of Climate Change within Fixed Income:

Climate change and other related environmental considerations are fundamentally integrated into our investment decisions Our Fixed Income team regularly evaluates the various potential costs of carbon and how it can affect capital expenditures and overall energy company profitability Our in-house investment teams generally take a broad-based approach to environmentally related evaluations including factoring in product responsibility and a companys impact on climate change When considering investments in fossil fuels, we feel it is important to balance the consideration of the current global economic dependence on energy with the need to reduce the impact of a warming planet
Climate change and rising carbon levels are significant global issues for consideration that need to be addressed by governments, by the energy industry, and by users of energy

Alteration of Investment Strategy:

Integration of Climate Change Risks and Opportunities within Fixed Income

Our investment managers teams generally take a broad-based approach to environmental, social and corporate risk governance (ESG) evaluation including factoring in product responsibility and a companys impact on climate change When considering investments in fossil fuels, we feel it is important to balance the consideration of the current global economic dependence on energy with the need to reduce the impact of a warming planet

We believe climate change issues can affect the risk profile of an array of issuers (including but not limited to corporates) and therefore we incorporate these into our overall investment process Assessing an issuers adoption of new regulations is one way in which we account for the transition to a low carbon economy when making investment decisions We also recognize that as climate change themes evolve, they will impact sectors and issuers at different times and in different ways As such it is important to recognize which issuers are on the right (or wrong) side of these trends, and to align when the impacts of these trends will play out with investment time horizons

Below, we outline examples where climate change issues impacted our investment decisions within our portfolios In certain industries, climate change issues are likely to be key risk and/or return drivers of the majority of names that we cover

Packaging: Several packaging companies have invested heavily in light-weighting of their products, which reduces shipping costs and reduces the consumption of carbon based raw materials, contributing to our positive bias in our research conclusions

Global Auto OEM: The global auto OEM sector faces increased carbon-related exposure driven by regulatory pressure on the industry to reduce tailpipe emissions This requires the development of new technologies, re-modelling fleets and capital investment to alter production facilities We may have a more negative view of an issuer that has failed to invest early in R&D to reduce fleet emissions and may have a more positive view of an issuer that has consistently invested in R&D ahead of the industry

Property & Catastrophe (P&C) Reinsurer: We evaluated a new issue from a property catastrophe (P&C) reinsurer with a global presence The issuer also manages catastrophe businesses for others P&C insurers typically provide probable maximum loss (PML) estimates PML is a measure of the largest loss that may occur in a particular geographic region (or entire book of business) given a specific peril of a given probability We observed that the issuer did not provide adequate PML estimates consistent with industry standards and the risks related to limited debt capacity, exposure to catastrophe zones and lack of associated disclosure were not appropriately priced in, resulting in a negative view of the issuer

Renewable Energy: In 2016, India, one of the worlds largest emitters of greenhouse gasses committed to the Paris global climate agreement, requiring 40% of its power generation to be from non-fossil sources by 2030 This provides an attractive industry backdrop for renewables in India In certain cases this provides an attractive industry backdrop for renewables in India

Utilization of Third-Party Climate Related Research & Data

The majority of our investment managers Fixed Incomes ESG assessment is conducted in- house by the investment manager The team utilizes Fluent, a platform which facilitates content management, workflow and screening for research analysts and is used as a centralized repository of all external and internally generated research Research can be stored and retrieved in a variety of ways, including ticker symbol, analyst name, investment theme, source, sector or country, making it seamless for our team members to share and retrieve all information on a company, sector or topic and further enhancing the communication lines within our teams

ESG considerations are incorporated within our fundamental research, including a designated section within Fluent (mentioned above) that captures material ESG factors Additionally, our investment managers FI team has begun providing assessments of ESG Performance and furthermore Environmental Exposure/Risk for individual issuers These ESG Performance assessments are assigned by the fundamental analysts and incorporate ESG themes, ESG related engagement and ESG third-party data that is curated from multiple sources

From a division-wide perspective, ESG themes are discussed within periodic meetings and ESG dedicated Chats Participants include all strategies within Fixed Income, as well as the Fundamental Equity Team, Quantitative Investment Strategy Team and the Imprint Team

The management of our fixed income portfolios employs the broad resources and expertise of the our investment managers Global Fixed Income and Liquidity Solutions Team comprising of over 295 professionals located across London, New York, Bengaluru, Salt Lake City, Singapore, San Francisco, Burlington, Tokyo and Sydney and Buenos Aires The team is divided into top-down and bottom-up strategy teams We believe that the strength of our investment research lies in our unique ability to delegate decision making to small teams of experts who are responsible and accountable for their investment views We consider this team approach vital to the long-term success of any active management strategy ESG is a significant component of our bottom-up fundamental research process We have a scalable and flexible investment process, which allows us to customize ESG investment solutions to our clients investment preferences and guidelines

While consideration of ESG factors are required of all members of investment teams, our investment managers Fixed Income team has also appointed ESG Team Leads within the various fixed income investment strategy teams ESG Team Leads (a combination of heads of research, analysts, traders and portfolio managers) serve as the main point of contact to the ESG dedicated team for evolving themes and data

As previously reported, Markel is in the process of consolidating all of their Markel North America data centers into a primary and backup site both of which are located in North America  In addition, Markel continues to make significant progress in migrating the Markel North American associate base to virtualized desktops  Virtualization is a process whereby applications are run in separate, isolated partitions (separate virtual machines) within a single server Widely used in datacenters, each virtual machine runs its own operating system and application, and can be moved or copied from one server to another for load balancing or to expand processing capability Along with greater utilization of hardware, this ""live migration"" feature is one of the major benefits of using virtual servers

The Company's affiliated non-insurance operations tend to engage in light manufacturing or service businesses and are not significant producers of emissions

The combination of data center consolidation and virtualization of computing environments is also expected to significantly reduce power consumption in support of business activities

Lemonade Ins Co,", a
public benefit corporation organized under Delaware Law and a Certified B-Corp (Parent
or collectively Lemonade) hereby submit the following in response to the annual
mandatory Insurer Climate Risk Disclosure Survey As a relatively new player in the
personal lines property and casualty space formed on a completely digital platform, we
recognize our responsibility to evaluate business opportunities and mitigate business risk
driven by climate change impact, and to do our part to ensure an insurable, resilient and
sustainable world We view climate change risks in two ways, one as risk to our business
and second as risk to the planet
Our founders set out to create an insurance Company for the future that reimagined the
traditional insurance model We strive to minimize volatility while maximizing trust and
social impact, by creating an aligned, trustful and values rich relationship with customers
Our desire to maintain rigorous standards of social and environmental performance,
accountability, and transparency made Lemonades choice to become a Certified B Corp
natural
The term ""Certified B Corp"" does not refer to a particular form of legal entity, but instead
refers to companies that are certified by B Lab, an independent nonprofit organization The
first step in becoming a Certified B Corp is taking and passing a comprehensive and
objective assessment of a business's positive impact on society and the environment The
assessment varies depending on the Company's number of employees, business sector, and
location The standards in the assessment are created and revised by an independent
governing body that determines eligibility to be a Certified B Corp
By completing a set of over 200 questions that reflect impact indicators, best practices, and
outcomes, and are customized for the Company being assessed, a Company receives a
composite score on a 200-point scale representative of its overall impact on its employees,
customers, communities, and the environment Representative indicators in the assessment
range from payment above a living wage, employee benefits, charitable giving/community
service, and use of renewable energy
Certification as a Certified B Corp requires that a Company achieve a reviewed assessment
score of at least 80 The review process includes a phone review and a random selection of
indicators for which documentation is verified The assessment also includes a disclosure
questionnaire, including any sensitive practices, fines, and sanctions related to the
Company or its partners
Our certification also required Lemonade to adopt the public benefit corporation structure,
a step we have already completed Once certified, every Certified B Corp must make its
assessment score transparent on the independent non-profit organization's website
Acceptance as a Certified B Corp and continued certification is at the sole discretion of the
independent organization A comprehensive re-certification is required every three years
Our next recertification will occur in 2022
The Company is a relatively small, young and completely digital insurance Company,
and as such a plan for reduction and mitigation of emissions in our operations is not
necessary, and as we grow and our footprint expands, we are conscientious about
keeping social and environmental factors central to our planning
Presently and for the foreseeable future, we rely completely on virtual cloud infrastructure
services hosted in AWS Web Services (""AWS"") which eliminates traditional data centers
and their related energy consumption We not only subscribe to the purpose driven
B-Corp principles but have made them part of the fabric of our Company, and are
committed to remaining continually mindful of the challenges climate change imposes on
operations as we consider business strategies and execution of those strategies",0

One of ACIAs largest risks is from frequent Midwest storms involving severe wind and hail, and the number of such incidents has seemingly increased over the past decade  The company has not specifically identified the source of the frequency as climate change  Rating actions take place annually to offset losses above what would be considered normal storm activity The company also monitors the exposure concentration across its footprint taking into account the propensity for storm activity in a given area to ensure the exposure from weather activity is within an acceptable range  Catastrophe exposure is monitored regularly and is reported to the Management Risk Committee annually  As mentioned above, annual modeling of any policy that is potentially exposed to a property loss for both single and multiple events occurs to assist in the monitoring of the effect of exposure and concentration changes on the expected average annual storm losses

State Farm is concerned about the prospect of climate change, its potential impact on severe weather patterns, and how that potential impact may affect the business of insurance  State Farm works with organizations across the country  such as the Insurance Institute for Building and Home Safety (IBHS) and the Federal Alliance for Safe Homes (FLASH)  to help protect our policyholders from the human injuries, property destruction and financial impact that can result from natural disasters and State Farm is also a member of the BuildStrong Coalition These efforts are focused on building codes, land use and awareness of mitigation issues

IBHS mission remains focused on strengthening homes and businesses to prevent avoidable suffering and reduce losses IBHS developed its 2021-2023 Disaster Safety Strategy as the next step forward in pioneering building science research and its application to real world property loss reduction To frame IBHSs goals being pursued under Disaster Safety Strategy, key commitments were developed to guide the way categorized under Pioneering Building Research, Proof Points for Resiliency and Consumer and Public Policy Advocacy

As noted above State Farm supports IBHS efforts and has adopted initiatives for policyholders based on the work of IBHS State Farm will continue to review and take appropriate action as IBHS continues to develop information and ways of strengthening homes and businesses to prevent avoidable suffering and reduce losses such as with regulations in Louisiana that allow insurance companies to provide discounts to IBHS Fortified products

In a Summary for Policymakers in 2014, the IPCC concluded, with a high degree of confidence, that two of the most effective [climate change] vulnerability reduction measures for health in the near term are programs thatsecure essential health care including vaccination and child health servicesand alleviate poverty KP is therefore proud that in 2018 we extended Medicaid and Children's Health Insurance Plan to more than 969,000 people, and provided our own charitable health coverage and medical financial assistance to 309,000 people
With regard to computer modeling, KP uses customized tools to conduct community health needs assessments in our communities These tools, which are freely available to the public at wwwchnaorg/kp, provide the capacity to view, map and analyze environmental conditions and health outcomes in a particular community, and provide information that can be applied to help any community KP uses these tools to guide it in conducting and publishing Community Health Needs Assessments (CHNAs) across all of the communities it serves These assessments are helping KP to identify, prioritize and address community health needs including poor health outcomes that are correlated with climate change
Another way that KP manages the risks of climate change is by limiting the carbon (and other environmental) footprint of its healthcare system Greater resource efficiency and increased reliance on renewable energy make KPs buildings and operations more resilient to fluctuations in the availability and prices of natural resources  Since 2013, KP has required Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Gold certification for all of its new construction of hospitals, large medical offices and other major projects   Over fifty KP buildings are now LEED certified and dozens have received Energy Star certification in the last two years

An example of a company distributing training materials to policyholders in an ecofriendly and cost effective manner is with the use of loss prevention specialists who train insureds to present Safety Meetings to their employees as it relates to high wind, changing road conditions, and winter driving conditions Additional training is also offered to those same policyholders via on demand videos and the training extends to cover any driver training that might be requested by the policyholder Online training allows the company to operate in a paperless environment and eliminates the need for physical training materials  Additionally, loss prevention specialists can implement the training from remote locations and avoid traveling long distances to do in-person training
As another example of services provided to policyholders, one company offers risk management services that include roof inspection during risk surveys to help determine the integrity of the roof covering, erosion/landslide risks, brush fire/forest fire precautions as well as use of loss prevention infrared thermography scanning and the results of these types of inspection information is communicated to the customer to help anticipate and reduce risks through increased knowledge and recommendations By doing so, the policyholder has the information needed that would allow him/her to act proactively and prevent the likelihood of a loss A related measure is a second company who offers aircraft hurricane relocation reimbursement expense coverage to named insureds that reimburse a portion of eligible expenses incurred for relocating the aircraft to a safer location when a threat of a hurricane arises A third company encourages their insureds to store certain scheduled property, such as artwork, off the ground and allow for it to be moved quickly in the event of a storm  Finally, a fourth office initiates risk management discussions after claims investigations or inspections to review any deficiencies in owned property and assist insureds in mitigating reoccurring exposure to losses  
An additional incentive used by one company in the group is the promotion of policyholder loss mitigation by offering green coverage endorsements for property, inland marine and equipment breakdown to policyholders to encourage them to convert to green products and materials Some Companies are in the process of adopting rating organizations green building endorsements with all of their property filings These endorsements support the green initiative and promote the use of environmentally friendly products that may reduce factors contributing to potential climate change related events 
One company providing coverages to publicly traded or large privately held companies, works closely with these insured entities who are by nature, complex, sophisticated operations already heavily focused on risk management, including climate change initiatives and are subject to SEC regulations requiring mandatory reporting and disclosure requirement with respect to Climate change issues to assist in managing these exposures  Additionally there are protocols that have emerged for voluntary reporting of environmental matters established by nongovernmental entities including disclosure of information regarding environmental, sustainability, corporate social responsibility and more recently climate change and greenhouse gas emissions  
The pressure to comply with these voluntary disclosures arise  from initiatives to  create  awareness  among  the  public  and  institutional  investors  to  compel companies to disclose environmental risk and impacts, and as a result to change their behavior to avoid future negative disclosure For these insured entities, disclosure takes on a broader process than simply complying with SEC requirements 
Because of the interrelationships of the stakeholders in the financial and economic marketplace, environmental disclosure is linked with environmental risk management Disclosure decisions are linked to the management of the risks that require disclosure Sustainability and social responsibility are key issues for large, sophisticated risks, and climate change is an important focus of socially responsible investors

Aetna Health of California,"4
Aetna is one of the nation's leading diversified health care benefits companies and as such we exhort our constituents to be responsible and protect/conserve resources, health care and otherwise  Part of Aetnas response to CDP 2014 Question 21b is somewhat responsive to this question:
Aetnas Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) process includes a multi-disciplinary review of business risks and emerging issues where controls and activities are identified to mitigate such risks and overseen by senior management, including the Audit Committee and Board of Directors

Our risk and opportunity identification process, with respect to climate change, are integrated into the risk management process
In addition Aetna also publishes an annual Corporate Responsibility booklet that is available at http://wwwaetnacom/about-aetna-insurance/document-library/corporate-responsibilitypdf Aetna addresses environmental sustainability on page 13 Aetna also publishes annually a more comprehensive Aetna Environmental Report detailing its progress on sustainability initiatives, which is available at http://wwwaetnacom/about-aetna-insurance/document-library/Aetna-2014-EnvironmentReportpdf Aetna is an active member of the Business Roundtable Group and lends its support to working with policymakers, NGOs and consumers to make their communities stronger and more sustainable, their products greener and more innovative and their operations cleaner and more efficient Aetna has also adopted an Environmental Policy Statement:
As a health care company, we believe nothing is more important than helping people stay healthy Aetnas business strategy includes promoting sustainable practices nationally and internationally in furtherance of the health of our members, employees and communities in which we operate
We are committed to limiting our own environmental impact by reducing our energy consumption, conserving environmental resources, and adopting a sustainable approach to the management and maintenance of all real estate and business processes wherever possible

American Standard Insurance Company of Wisconsin," It is our opinion that the perils that are most volatile due to changes in climate are hurricane (due to water temperature changes) and wildfire (due to heat and drought conditions) American Family utilizes multiple catastrophe models to evaluate our risk arising from these natural catastrophe perils 

While the models continue to become more sophisticated, there is still uncertainty around the outputs For this reason, the company employs an approach that considers historical loss experience and total insured values at risk by location in addition to model output Additionally, we limit uncertainty and variability in results by ensuring high data quality of model inputs

Finally as discussed in question 3, the result of catastrophe modeling is included in our capital adequacy modeling analysis in order to provide assurance that the organizations level of capital is adequate for the catastrophe risk as well as other risks faced

As an addendum to the climate survey, below are excerpts taken from our InBusiness Sustainable
Business Awards Application
We believe there is a strong correlation between protection and sustainability and well-being We have
a dedicated sustainability specialist on staff, a full time sustainability intern, established sustainability
squads and a social media sustainability community that champions behaviors, principles and practices
serving to educate, inspire and implement new ways of doing business throughout our operating areas
We further inspire and empower employees through diversity, wellness, innovation and sustainability
programs providing opportunities to engage with what resonates most with them individually
Sustainability Plan
On a very broad level, like many key trends, sustainability is a journey It has moved from a doing what
is required to creating shared value It is an expectation equally as valued as safety, quality, and
ultimately customer and employee well-being The early stages of sustainability are about catching up
The future is about integrating sustainability into our core business Each of us has an opportunity to
think about how sustainability drives innovation and what that means for our own lives, our schools, our
communities, our business organizations and our overall well-being
Our Sustainability Plan, authored in 2008 identified 8 key objectives
1 Reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions
2 Reduce waste
3 Reduce water use
4 Reduce operational impact on land
5 Reduce negative environmental impact on food service
6 Enhance sustainable social practices
7 Implement sustainable economic practices
8 Advocate sustainable procurement
Each year, we use these objectives as guidelines for projects The plan keeps the greater sustainability
picture in mind, as well In addition to growing the business, we strive to be social, ethical and
environmental stewards
ENERGY USE
EPA Energy Star Portfolio
American Family is passionate about reducing our energy use All of our owned buildings are registered
in the Environmental Protection Agencys (EPA) Energy Star Portfolio Program, which measures our
targeted energy reduction solutions (which includes high efficiency lighting, mechanical component
retrofits, and building operating adjustments) Currently three of our owned facilities are Energy Star
certified
Energy Management Strategy Team
The Energy Management Strategy Team was established in 2012, with a Facilities Program Administrator
appointed as the strategy lead This team meets biweekly In addition, subcommittees were created to
work on facets of this strategy relating to project prioritization, ideation, measurement models,
recognition and an annual scorecard We are leveraging our internal innovation platform to engage
stakeholders company-wide, vet opportunities related to energy efficiency and help prioritize those
opportunities The goal for December 2013 is to establish an ideation model that emphasizes the
people component of People, Planet, Profit
Exceed Energy Savings Goal In 2007, American Family set a goal of reducing energy consumption by 15%
by 2016 We actually met that goal four years early in 2012 and are currently in the process of setting a
new energy reduction goal
In our Wisconsin owned buildings, we have reduced overall energy usage since our 2007 baseline
This accounts for a reduction of 9,858 metric tons of CO2 emissions from Q1 2007 through Q1 2013
Data Center Upfits
One significant recent success was installing variable frequency drives in data centers and non-data air
conditioning centers to reduce energy use Because we strive for our successes to include continuous
improvement loops, we are monitoring this reduction and will make changes as needed to make this
system as efficient as possible
WATER USE
Exceed Water Savings Goal
In 2008, we set a goal of reducing our water use by 20% by 2016 We reached that goal in 2011 By
converting our cooling tower to soft water, we are saving over 7 million gallons of water per year, which
is the equivalent of 116 Olympic-sized swimming pools
Community Engagement and Awareness
Many employees volunteered for the first Monona (Wis) Water Walk in 2012, and we shared that out
through our social media Currently, we are exploring the opportunity to partner for a volunteer day
focusing on the Yahara River watershed, in the Madison area
MATERIALS CONSUMPTION
Zero Waste Initiative
Our Zero Waste Initiative is currently gaining momentum We have partnered with the City of Madison
to participate in its pilot composting program, which involves our organic waste being hauled to a
location in Columbia County Our landfilled waste is hauled to Rockford, Ill, so our carbon footprint will
decrease as the amount of organic waste hauled to Columbia County increases In the first phase of the
project, we will recycle all bathroom paper towels and pre-consumer kitchen waste at our headquarters
only This amounts to approximately one 40 yard compactor each month
Since 2007, we have reduced our landfill waste by 24% or 9,858 metric tons This was primarily
accomplished through a rigorous recycling program that in addition to single stream recycling, includes
the diversion of construction waste, furniture and scrap metal among other materials
Robust Recycling Program
American Family is committed to a dynamic recycling program Employees at the Madison-area offices
recycled over 1,167,020 pounds of paper in 2012 Based on facility occupancy of 4,300 in the Madison
area (the headquarters and a regional building), this is the equivalent to each employee recycling 270
pounds of paper per person Support for our recycling program since its start in 1989 has produced an
impressive 31,200,486 pounds or over 15,600 tons of recycled paper, generating $1,089,12600 of
combined paper rebate and landfill cost savings That's a group effort equal to saving a virtual forest of
265,204 trees Overall, the Madison area offices recycle an impressive 71% of their waste stream
Sustainable Procurement
This initiative aims to improve the procurement process by allowing purchasing agents to procure more
sustainable supplies We have found that vendors are very willing to research and offer more
sustainable alternatives to products we use every day Plans for our sustainability purchasing encompass
procurement, materials management, logistics, supply chain management and business continuity
activities The intent of sustainability purchasing is to shift spending away from goods and services that
negatively impact the environment and society towards products that are more environmentally sound
and socially and ethically beneficial
Brown Envelope Campaign
In 2012, during our second year of participating in the Madison MPower program, we initiated the
Brown Envelope Campaign to reduce our use of virgin paper The goal: to source 100% of customerfacing
paper correspondence with paper containing post-consumer recycled content We now use paper
sourced with 10% and 30% post-consumer recycled content This equates to 455 tons of paper now
sourced from post consumer recycled content, reducing 145 tons of waste and eliminating 82 cars off
the road each year (Source: EPAs Carbon Calculator)
Parallel to the brown envelope campaign, there is also an effort underway to improve our mailing
system overall in order to reduce the amount of material sent to customers This will not only make our
customers satisfied due to receiving less mail, but we will also reduce the amount of paper consumed
There has also been an increased effort corporate-wide to inform customers of our online billing option
to further reduce paper consumption
POLLUTING EMISSIONS
Solar Photovoltaic Arrays
Through targeted energy reduction solutions, American Family Insurance has reduced greenhouse gas
emissions by an estimated 7,538 metric tons which is the equivalent of over 17,5000 barrels of oil Since
2011, four of our facilities have rooftop solar power array systems which lead to savings on average of
4607 metric tons of CO2 per year
Day Cleaning
Sustainable cleaning practices have been implemented which involves day cleaning Day-cleaning is
considered a progressive and sustainable cleaning approach that contributes to reduced energy
consumption and greater social responsibility The new solution is incorporating green certified cleaning
chemicals and sustainable cleaning protocols such as use of micro fiber dusting materials and low
decibel vacuums This effort reduces the amount of electricity used after business hours and throughout
the night In addition to lowering emissions, this change also supports workforce development by
allowing housekeeping employees to live a regular schedule, which is more conducive to a happy,
healthy lifestyle
END-OF-LIFE ISSUES (areas to consider: reusability, recyclability, biodegradability)
Life Cycle Assessment
The Facilities Program Administrator is currently chartering a project to create standards for end-ofuseful-
life for equipment We currently strive to maximize equipment life by analyzing the condition of
components of various equipment and replacing components as is environmentally and economically
viable We will soon have a clear-cut, efficient infrastructure life cycle assessment tool that will improve
our ability to make sustainable choices when it comes to maintaining equipment or purchasing new
equipment
Warehouse Optimization  Office Supplies
Another program in place that focuses on end-of-life issues is our gently used office supplies program
Several employees championed the task of creating a reusable office supplies stockroom in our Mayfair
Warehouse There is an updated list of items that are available for use This program not only reduces
expenses, but it also reduces the amount of materials that need to be produced when we are able to
reuse what we already own Relating to this effort, every time the organization facilitates a move or
remodel, employees have the opportunity to repurpose gently used office supplies
Ewaste Event
Each year, there is an ewaste recycling event where employees can bring in personal electronics to
recycle at the national headquarters and East Regional Building for free In 2010, we diverted over
58,000 pounds of electronic waste  our goal for 2013 is to surpass that amount
TRANSPORTATION
Corporate Fleet
American Family Insurance has a dedicated employee on staff, our Fleet, Trucking, and Records
Retention Manager, who researches fuel-efficient vehicles, attends conferences and tradeshows, and
calculates cost-benefit analyses on fuel-efficient vehicles This manager sends out a sustainability
quarterly newsletter to the fleet drivers about fuel-efficient driving techniques in order to teach staff
about how to extend the life of the car while also polluting less and consuming less gasoline
The fleet team uses a widely respected software program to keep track of the carbon footprint of their
fleet, which produces monthly graphs showing this footprint We rank #38 on Automotive Fleet
Magazines Top 750 Green Fleets annual ranking American Family Insurance owns 1,273 vehicles; 915
of them are flex-fuel, and one is a hybrid electric vehicle
Bike Friendly Business
The national headquarters is considered a Bicycle-Friendly Business by the League of American Bicyclists
due to efforts of creating safe bike paths leading to and from the campus, offering bike racks and
shower stalls for bicyclists
Access to Public Transportation
American Family worked with the municipal public transit authority to establish a Madison Metro bus
stop right outside the main door of the headquarters during prime commuting hours, which helps make
taking the bus to and from work more convenient Our coffee shops inside the headquarters sell bus
passes to further promote public transportation as a sustainable option, and for the convenience of our
employees
OTHER  SITE AND HABITAT ENHANCEMENT
Land Management
After NHQ was built, much of the land was planted with a highway grass seeding consisting of nonnative
European grasses and forbs Not long after this, an employee spotted a Dickcissel, a native
Wisconsin prairie bird whose numbers have been declining due mostly to habitat loss Soon after that,
American Family made it a priority to maintain and improve the habitat already established and to
recover or reestablish lost habitat
The national headquarters pioneered an effort in 2009 to plant a native prairie on the grounds  the
prairie now covers 20 acres In addition to restoring the land to a prairie, we are also trying to restore
the Oak Savannah Oak Savannah is considered one of the most endangered ecosystems worldwide The
only remaining pieces of it exist mostly on private land in isolated clumps Here at NHQ, we are
reintroducing the elements that formerly shaped the land in an attempt to return it to its natural state
Of these elements, the most influential is fire Every spring, a prescribed burn is carried out on a
weekend It creates an extremely nutrient-rich layer for prairie plants to establish in and thrive off
American Family works closely with wildlife ecology officials from local universities to monitor site
biodiversity Depending on location and property size, our natural surroundings are inhabited by a
considerable array of wildlife; 75 acres of land at the national headquarters have been set aside as a
wildlife retreat
Each year since 1996, the national headquarters has hired a seasonal Habitat Enhancement Intern This
person is involved in multiple site and habitat enhancement efforts including leading outdoor classroom
sessions on various land management issues, administering the bluebird nest box monitoring program
(we have 34 blue bird houses on site that volunteers check on and report to a national entity),
conducting the annual grassland bird survey, monitoring the pond for water clarity, overseeing the
annual NHQ pond fishing season, and handling fish census data The intern provides onsite education to
staff on a range of topics such as native prairie planting and species, butterfly gardens, aquatic invasives
and how to prevent them from spreading, invasive plant species and bluebird management
EPA Energy Star Portfolio
Energy Star is used to track our sustainability progress relating to utilities for all of our owned buildings
A dedicated Facilities Technician tracks all of the utility bills using Energy Star and puts the electricity
and gas use in graphs for every owned Wisconsin office, including the warehouses and airplane hangar
There are monthly facilities meetings that review the graphs to discuss trends, energy/sustainability
projects that have been completed and their impacts, and brainstorming new projects to be completed
Construction and Demolition Waste Diversion
American Family is currently in the process of developing a standard sustainability model for
construction and demolition waste when constructing or remodeling an owned office The current
Workplace Sustainability Intern is developing a waste management strategy that will be used in
accordance with LEED 10 requirements which will allow us to divert as much waste as possible from the
landfill (our current goal is a 95% diversion)

State Farm Florida Insurance Company,"  State Farm works with organizations across the country  such as the Institute for Building and Home Safety (IBHS), ProtectingAmericaorg, and the Federal Alliance for Safe Homes  to help protect our policyholders from the human injuries, property destruction and financial impact that can result from natural disasters  These efforts are focused on building codes, land use and general awareness of mitigation issues

The following text, prepared by IBHS, is a brief description of the Institute and some of its activities that relate to the issue of climate change
IBHS is a 501(c)(3) organization, wholly supported by the property (re)insurance industry, which conducts objective, scientific research to identify and promote effective actions that strengthen homes, businesses, and communities against natural disasters and other causes of loss IBHS does this by identifying and advocating improved property design, construction, retrofitting, maintenance, repair, and preparation practices  IBHS guidance for mitigating property losses is available directly to the public and to our members/policyholders, at wwwdisastersafetyorg, and through social media (eg, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, YouTube and Vimeo)
IBHS advocates the concept of going green and building strong recognizing that addressing climate change involves both  reducing greenhouse gas emissions and adapting homes, businesses, and communities to severe weather that may result from climate change:
	As an insurance-supported organization, IBHS recognizes that climate change strategies must do more than build structures to be energy efficient  They must be built to modern fire protection standards to help resist fire and avoid the water/chemical deluge needed for fire suppression; they should be strong enough to avoid wind destruction and resulting relocation in landfills; and properties should be sited and elevated in a manner that protects against flooding and environmental degradation from landslides  All of these are part of going green
	IBHS also firmly believes that adaptation is critical, not only to reduce long-term property insurance losses, but to buttress individual and societal resilience  All of the property protection measures that IBHS advocates to strengthen structures against current weather threats will also reduce future losses caused by climate change events  And, the unprecedented scientific research conducted at the unique IBHS Research Center is critical to identification of new mitigation actions that may help protect against more severe weather events
	Additionally, research conducted by IBHS will help to make sure that green building enhancements do not inadvertently cause structures to be less disaster-resistant, or even worse, threaten the life safety of occupants or first respondersfor example, photovoltaic arrays that take flight or pose fire suppression challenges are the antithesis of building strong  

As a building science institute, and due to antitrust concerns, IBHS does not have access to, and cannot compile, a list of market-based discounts offered by specific insurers with respect to current or future weather scenarios  That said, IBHS research helps its member companies to better understand structural vulnerability and the role that mitigation plays in reducing damage from severe weather, as well as what mitigation features to look for when inspecting a residential or commercial building
A few states (Alabama, Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi, North Carolina, and South Carolina) have developed legislative or regulatory discount frameworks for homes built or retrofitted to the code-plus, hazard-specific FORTIFIED new construction and retrofit standards developed by IBHS  In these states, the Institute has worked with insurance regulators and insurance companies to make sure that the discount programs work as they were intended upon enactment, and actually facilitate risk-based pricing, which can serve both to encourage effective mitigation and discourage unsound development in disaster-prone areas 
The quickest way for individual property owners to find out if their residential or commercial building qualifies for an incentive (for example, by meeting the designation requirements of the FORTIFIED program) is to ask their insurance department or company  In addition to discounts, insurance incentives related to mitigation may include a positive decision by an underwriter to provide coverage in the voluntary, rather than through the residual market, lower deductibles, or more favorable coverage terms relating to post-disaster claims payments  Again, these are business decisions made by individual insurers, and IBHS neither influences such decisions nor specifically tracks them

Symetra Life Insurance,"  We address potential impacts of climate change as part of our risk model, which draws on risk-based capital concepts  In the model, risks are classified into four main categories:
	Investment risks;
	Pricing risks, including determination of adequate spreads or premiums, and estimation of claims, both expected and catastrophic;
	Interest rate risk, including asset/liability duration matching exposures;
	Other business risks, including business continuity, data security, and other operational risks
The potential impact of climate change, such as hurricanes or natural disasters, is addressed in this model by reviewing geographic concentration in our investment and pricing risk assessments",1

The actual level and type of risk assessment employed in each situation depends on many factors: the nature of the risk, its materiality to Chubb, the quality of the data, the underlying facts and science and, finally, potential actions post-assessment Quantification typically involves an assessment of the severity and likelihood of occurrence, analysis of Chubbs exposures (eg underwriting limits deployed, counter-party exposure) relative to risk measures (eg earnings, capital, liquidity, industry market share) and other considerations, such as collateral Specific examples of risk assessment measures utilized are accumulation and scenario These analyses may be supported by other activities including analytics, claims, actuarial, legal, investments and underwriting

Chubb is a leading proponent and user of catastrophe models to quantify natural catastrophe risk for product pricing, risk management, capital allocation and to simulate and estimate hurricane losses Chubb uses models to aggregate and closely monitor natural catastrophe exposures across its global portfolio and to ensure that its capital base is sufficiently strong to meet the expectations of regulators, rating agencies and policyholders and to provide shareholders with an appropriate risk-adjusted return This information is valuable in identifying possible market opportunities, including where and how we might be able to offer coverage to consumers and businesses in areas exposed to natural perils Chubbs risk management modeling and underwriting practices are adapted to the developing risk exposures attributed to climate change Since the earths climate appears to be changing in ways inconsistent with the historical record upon which catastrophe models draw data, Chubb has adopted a framework to think about how changes in short- and long-term frequency should be factored into its risk management systems Standard & Poors rated Chubbs ERM process Strong in its June 2018 ERM Rating Report, placing Chubb among the top 20% of North America and Bermuda insurers Chubb invests to continually upgrade and refine its risk management tools for catastrophes such as floods and hurricanes Chubb accounts for the potential impact of catastrophe and climate risks on the companys own facilities and operations Direct risk to Chubbs business operations exists if such weather events occur where Chubb has offices Severe weather events have tested Chubbs Business Continuity Program and operations have functioned effectively Chubbs risk analysis ranges from the known (based on definitive historical loss experience) to the hypothetical (based on a probable maximum loss (PML) calculation)

Through the use of catastrophe models, Chubb manages severe weather risk to indirect client exposures throughout the world Special emphasis is given to areas where Chubb has significant exposures and the inherent risk from extreme weather events  such as tropical cyclone and other windstorm  is deemed to be high, such as the coastal United States, Southeast Asia and UK/Europe To aid in prioritizing management focus on extreme weather events, each peril region is classified as either Tier 1, 2 or 3 according to the exposures and risk combination present Tier 1 regions are the highest priority areas for the company as they present the greatest risk profile and are the most carefully managed Tier 2 and 3 regions are also closely managed at the regional and business unit level In addition to modeled peril regions, we focus on non-modeled perils, such as flood, which present a risk in many of the developing areas of the Chubb insurance portfolio We continue to invest in developing and refining tools to identify and track our exposures related to flood, given an increasing incidence in flood losses in our property insurance portfolio over the last decade

Since the insurance products that we provide clients around the world may provide coverage for all of the risks noted, there are potential financial implications for Chubb The extent of potential negative implications depends on whether the loss is covered by the policy's terms and conditions and whether the underlying assumptions modeled in determining the pricing of the policy adequately reflect the potential risk If the model used to price coverage proves faulty or doesnt anticipate the potential magnitude of these risks in the future, then losses paid could exceed premiums collected, causing the company to draw a higher amount from its loss reserve pool that is set aside to pay future claims Conversely, if actual loss experience is lower than anticipated, positive adjustments could be made to reserve levels, producing a financial gain for the company If losses are not covered by Chubbs policies, or if the losses are within the assumptions used to price the coverage, then there would be no adverse financial implications for Chubb",2
State Auto Property & Casualty,"  The company is in a service industry, which is considered to be a relatively low contributor to emissions  The company recognizes it is important to consider the impact it has on the environment It encourages a culture in which all of its employees are aware of opportunities to conserve energy and be good stewards of natural resources  State Auto is committed to implementing efficiencies as opportunities are evaluated and potential environmental impacts are considered  Such efforts diminish the environmental footprint, which in turn has beneficial effects on pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, landfill burdens and fuel and water consumption  

State Auto works to purchase and use energy in an efficient, cost effective and responsible manner This affects the way we manage facilities, a fleet of vehicles and travel For example, the company has selected more fuel efficient vehicles We are replacing less fuel efficient vehicles with more efficient models while also maintaining and monitoring regular maintenance of our fleet, leading to a decrease in fuel consumption In 2018, our vehicles consumed 278,448 gallons of fuel compared to 256,337 gallons in 2019, a decrease in fuel consumption of 86% Since 2015, weve reduced our vehicle fleet size from 357 units to 285, a reduction of 20%, while growing our core business In 2019 the reduction continued as we reduced our fleet from 289 units down to 285, a decrease of 4 units or 14% We expect this trend to continue due continued efforts to manage the size of our fleet and improving operating efficiency from our vehicles     

In conjunction with the SMART Columbus initiative, State Auto introduced a ride share program in 2019 As many employees commute to business locations, State Auto promotes carpooling programs and encourages ridesharing, the use of public transportation and biking to work  We continued to support a CoGo Bike Share station on our corporate headquarters campus This provides easy access to associates for short trips in our downtown area  We encourage work from home options whenever possible to further reduce the need for commuting and additional office space At the time of writing this update, almost 90% of State Auto associates are working from home and have been since mid-March 2020 due to the impact of COVID-19 State Auto is committed to serving customers locally, placing field associates near independent agency representatives and policyholders, reducing the need for planes, trains and longer automobile rides  To further limit travel, the company utilizes telephonic and web-based conferences, along with video conferencing systems in multiple employee locations 


State Auto is committed to a multi-year project to consolidate our central Ohio employees into one work location, our corporate headquarters We are renovating floors in our two home office campus buildings to allow for the movement of associates from outside Central Ohio locations into our corporate headquarters by the end of 2020 2019 accomplishments include a complete renovation of 3rd floor office space in our Broad Street building and the demolition of the Boone Street storage building that had been part of our home office complex The space occupied by the former Boone Street building was converted into additional parking 2020 plans include complete renovation of floors #1 & 2 of the Broad Street building, and the west side of the 3rd floor of the Pavilion building  

Floor renovations noted above include brighter, more efficient use of energy and space Sensors allow for lights to automatically turn off when work areas are not in use  New work stations allow for a more collaborative work environment and reduce the required square footage per associate New updated mechanicals will also be part of these renovations, leading to a decrease in energy consumption 

Our mission to improve use of space and energy goes beyond our corporate headquarters location We moved our Indianapolis, IN associates to a newer more energy efficient location during 2018 In 2019, we moved associates in our West Des Moine, IA office into brighter more energy efficient office spaces We plan to move our Nashville, TN associates into more energy efficient space by the end of 2020 We have four external offices where we will allow leases to expire in the first half of 2021 Associates currently assigned to these offices will then work from home As noted earlier, almost 90% of SA associates are currently working from home now due to COVID-19   

Since 2015, we have reduced our average space per employee from 501 sq ft per associate to 338 sq ft per associate at the end of 2019, a 48% reduction Renovations underway in 2020 and 2021 will continue to reduce the footprint of space needed per associate, leading to even more efficient use of space and energy consumed by State Auto   
      
One of the most environmentally friendly changes we have made involved our decision to become a more digital company All of our personal lines new business is now done on our digital platform The last states for business owners and commercial auto policies being introduced to the digital platform were introduced in 2019 In 2020 we will begin the rollout of our farm, workers compensation and commercial package policies on the digital platform  
These new products utilize electronic transmission of policy and billing information to our agents and policyholders, dramatically reducing the amount of paper being consumed and policy information delivered via the USPS

We strongly encourage recycling of paper, cardboard, plastic, glass and cans  Such recycling efforts have been in place for well over 10 years We support a composting program in our corporate headquarters to minimize the amount of material going to our local landfill Automatic fixtures and waterless urinals are used in a growing number of restrooms and green traps have also been installed in bathrooms  which help with water conservation   We maintain a strict preventative maintenance schedule for equipment, which also benefits the reduction of energy usage and emissions

Stonebridge Life Insurance Company,"  As part of our work in preparing for the CDP questionnaire we looked at climate change risk under three categories:

A	Risks driven by changes in regulation

International agreements-Governments signing up to international agreements to reduce CO2 emissions could impose costs on some of our local country units Increased operational cost-Unknown-Direct-About as likely as not-Low-Without knowing the specifics of what future regulation could mean it is difficult to estimate the financial implications We believe that future legislation to reduce carbon emissions would increase our operational costs	Our approach is to monitor the development of legislation and regulation to see how they can impact our business As things develop we will refine our risk assessment Our Public Policy and Regulatory Affairs department currently monitors change in regulation and legislation There is no additional cost for them to continue monitoring changes in environmental legislation

Air pollution limits-We could be liable for penalties if we exceeded CO2 emissions set by governments As an office-based company, however, the impact is not likely to be very significant on our business-Increased operational cost-Unknown-Direct-Unlikely-Low Without knowing the specifics of what future regulation could mean it is difficult to estimate the financial implications We believe that future legislation to reduce carbon emissions would increase our operational costs	Our approach is to monitor the development of legislation and regulation to see how they can impact our business As things develop we will refine our risk assessment Our Public Policy and Regulatory Affairs department currently monitors change in regulation and legislation There is no additional cost for them to continue monitoring changes in environmental legislation

Carbon taxes-Carbon taxes imposed on other companies could impact their long-term potential returns thereby negatively affecting their share price of the companies we invest in-Reduced stock price (market valuation)->6 years-Indirect(Client)-About as likely as not-Low-medium-Without knowing the specifics of what future regulation could mean it is difficult to estimate the financial implications We believe that imposing carbon taxes on companies in some industries could have an impact on their operating models and consequently the value of the company  Our portfolio managers monitor developments in this area and incorporate information into their investment decision making process This is an ongoing process and so we do not foresee an additional internal cost for our portfolio managers to continue monitoring developments in this area

Cap and trade schemes-Cap and trade schemes imposed on other companies could impact their long-term potential returns thereby negatively affecting their share price-Reduced stock price (market valuation)->6 years-Indirect (Client)-About as likely as not-Low-medium Without knowing the specifics of what future regulation could mean it is difficult to estimate the financial implications We believe that imposing carbon taxes on companies in some industries could have an impact on their operating models and consequently the value of the company Our portfolio managers monitor developments in this area and incorporate information into their investment decision making process	This is an ongoing process and so we do not foresee an additional internal cost for our portfolio managers to continue monitoring developments in this area

Fuel/energy taxes and regulations-UK Carbon Reduction Commitment  could lead to increased operational costs-Increased operational cost-Up to 1 year-Direct-Very likely-LowAs part of our CRC commitment we pay on approximately GBP 175K for allowances under the scheme In the UK we have several programs in place to help us manage our energy spend Our CO2 emissions are directly related to our energy use, consequently our approach is to manage our use of electricity and gas as well as possible We have implemented many of the programs to make our buildings as energy efficient as possible Current programs are often behavioural in nature and encourage people to use less resources

Renewable energy regulation-Alternative energy projects are often highly dependent on government subsidies and incentives Removing these subsidies could negatively impact the long-term viability of this sector and therefore impact our impact investment portfolio-Other: Reduction in value of our assets-Unknown-Direct-About as likely as not-Low  Without having more concrete information on policy regarding the stimulation of green technologies it is difficult to estimate the financial implication Removing subsidies could make the return on some investments less attractive Our portfolio managers monitor developments in this area and incorporate information into their investment decision making process	This is an ongoing process and so we do not foresee an additional internal cost for our portfolio managers to continue monitoring developments in this area

B	Risks driven by changes in physical parameters

Other physical climate drivers-Climate change can pose a significant risk to the companies in which we invest We have established a Responsible Investment Policy to incorporate environmental, social, and governance criteria into our ownership and decision making criteria Also, our Responsible Investment Committee monitors ongoing and emerging risks-Reduced stock price (market valuation)->6 years-Direct-More likely than not-Low-medium-The value of companies in carbon intensive industries may be affected if regulations change imposing a price on carbon This could have a negative impact on the value of such companies Until more information is known it will be difficult to calculate the estimated financial implication	Our responsible investment teams continue to monitor developments in this area and will adjust our investment strategy as things develop There is no additional cost of managing this risk Our portfolio managers look at environmental, social, and governance risks as part of our responsible investment policy

Uncertainty of physical risks-Climate change brings an increased risk of business interruption due to flooding or other extreme weather conditions We have developed a business disruption plan to address such situations-Inability to do business-Unknown-Direct-Unlikely-Low-The risk of business interruption could occur at any time We have contingency plans in place to recover operations so that service to clients is not interrupted We have contracted with offsite service providers for temporary office space and staff have the ability to work remotely if necessary We have not made precise estimates of the costs involved Business interruption is a risk that is monitored on an ongoing basis by our operational risk management teams	There is no additional cost to managing this risk as our operational risk management teams are already monitoring business interruption risk as one of our ongoing operational risks

Change in mean (average) temperature-Changes in mean temperature can result in additional heating and cooling for our offices-Increased operational cost-Unknown-Direct-About as likely as not-Low-We keep track of our energy use over time at all of our key offices While temperature changes do impact our energy bills this does not have a significant impact on our operational costs of running the business Energy costs represent a very small portion of our operational costs when compared to salaries and other expenses-Our property services teams measure our energy use on an ongoing basis and take appropriate action as necessary As part of our ongoing efforts to manage our energy use we are looking for ways to be more efficient by doing things like installing LED lights where possible There is no additional cost to tracking this risk as our property services teams area already monitoring our energy use

Change in temperature extremes-	Changes in temper-atures could result in business interruption if our employees are not able to get to work due to extreme weather conditions-Inability to do business-Unknown-Direct-About as likely as not-Low-We keep track of our energy use over time at all of our key offices While temperature changes do impact our energy bills this does not have a significant impact on our operational costs of running the business Energy costs represent a very small portion of our operational costs when compared to salaries and other expenses-Our property services teams measure our energy use on an ongoing basis and take appropriate action as necessary As part of our ongoing efforts to manage our energy use we are looking for ways to be more efficient by doing things like installing LED lights where possible There is no additional cost to tracking this risk as our property services teams area already monitoring our energy use

Change in precipitation pattern-Increased risk of flooding, causing business interruption and increased claims from policy holders in our property and casualty business	Increased operational cost-Unknown-Direct-About as likely as not-Low-The risk of business interruption could occur at any time We have contingency plans in place to recover operations so that service to clients is not interrupted We have contracted with offsite service providers for temporary office space and staff have the ability to work remotely if necessary We have not made precise estimates of the costs involved	Business interruption is a risk that is monitored on an ongoing basis by our operational risk management teams There is no additional cost to managing this risk as our operational risk management teams are already monitoring business interruption risk as one of our ongoing operational risks

Change in precipitation extremes and droughts-While our main business lines are life insurance and pensions we do offer property and casualty insurance in some markets Changes in precipitation patterns such as flooding and droughts could result in higher claims, thereby impacting our profitability -Increased operational cost-Unknown-Direct About as likely as not-Low-Changes in precipitation patterns such as flooding and droughts could result in higher claims, thereby impacting our profitability-We manage this risk through a combination of monitoring our claims pattern in our non-life business and ensuring that our risks are appropriately reinsured so that we continue to run a profitable business Claims ratios are monitored on an ongoing risk by our risk department Our costs could risk if the risk increased and we needed to take out additional reinsurance contracts on our non-life business

Snow and ice-Heavy snowfall can result in business interruption if our employees are not able to get to work due to extreme weather conditions-Inability to do business	Unknown-Direct-About as likely as not-Low-The risk of business interruption could occur at any time We have contingency plans in place to recover operations so that service to clients is not interrupted We have contracted with offsite service providers for temporary office space and staff have the ability to work remotely if necessary We have not made precise estimates of the costs involved Business interruption is a risk that is monitored on an ongoing basis by our operational risk management teams	There is no additional cost to managing this risk as our operational risk management teams are already monitoring business interruption risk as one of our ongoing operational risks

Snow and ice-Removing snow and ice also increases our operating costs, and has the potential to increase workers compensation claims due to slips and falls Increased operational cost-Unknown-Direct-Likely-Low-The cost of removing snow and ice would lead to increased operational costs and a potential increase in our workers compensation premiums should the number of claims increase These costs are not material when compared to our overall operational costs Our property services teams ensure that access to our facilities is maintained despite the weather conditions The cost of managing this risk is minimal and not something that is separately tracked by the company

C	Risks that are driven by changes in other climate related developments

Reputation-We are an office-based company and therefore not a large emitter of CO2 gases We have adopted a Responsible Investment Policy where we take environmental factors into consideration in our decision making To maintain our creditability in this area, we need to demonstrate that we are also committed to monitoring our environmental footprint  There is a direct reputational risk if we are not seen as being on the ""right side"" of the climate change debate-Reduced demand for goods/services-Unknown-Direct-About as likely as not-Low-The potential exists that, should our reputation be damaged as a result of our activities related to the environment, our share price may be impacted As an office based company the risk of our reputation being damaged by an environmental incident is minimal compared to the risks related to our investments We have an environmental policy covering our own operations We have implemented a Responsible Investment Policy to ensure that environmental, social and governance issues are taken into consideration as part of our investment decision making process We also have a Sustainable Procurement Policy to ensure that we evaluate the environmental, social, and governance risks in our supply chain The procedures for managing this risk are already in place so there is no additional cost

Fluctuating socio-economic conditions-Climate change can have a direct impact on the risks and opportunities facing the companies and countries we invest in, thereby impacting their value Reduced stock price (market valuation)-Unknown-Direct-LikelyLow-medium-The impact of climate change could negatively affect the value of some of the companies we invest in It is difficult to give a reliable estimate as to how much this would be Our responsible investment teams continue to assess the impact environmental issues will have on the value of the companies we invest in They will take the necessary steps to ensure that our investment strategy is adapted to any changes that may occur as a result of developments in this area The procedures for managing this risk are already in place so there is no additional cost

Changing consumer behaviour-Climate change is also having an impact on how and where people live Movements in where people live and their economic prosperity will have an effect on demand for our products and services	Reduced demand for goods/services-Unknown-Indirect (Client)-Likely-Low-medium-This is a long term risk and one that will be felt over the course of time The financial implications for us lie in identifying trends in the market place and adapting to them in a timely manner Our responsible investment teams continue to assess the impact environmental issues will have on the value of the companies we invest in They will take the necessary steps to ensure that our investment strategy is adapted to any changes that may occur as a result of developments in this area The procedures for managing this risk are already in place so there is no additional cost

Changing consumer behaviour-As consumers become more aware of the impact of climate change, they may demand more products and services that are seen to address the issue If we are not in a position to provide the products and services demanded by consumers we may lose market share-Reduced demand for goods/services-Unknown-Indirect (Client)-Unlikely-Low-medium-The implications of this risk will evolve gradually over time In some cases creating opportunities for us and in others creating situations where demand for some of the products offered by the companies we invest in may change impacting the value of those companies It is difficult to point to provide a reliable estimate of the impact this will have on the value of the companies we invest in Our responsible investment teams continue to assess the impact environmental issues will have on the value of the companies we invest in They will take the necessary steps to ensure that our investment strategy is adapted to any changes that may occur as a result of developments in this area The procedures for managing this risk are already in place so there is no additional cost We currently offer socially responsible investment funds to our clients

Regence BlueShield of Idaho," Accordingly, for each response in this survey, a reference to Cambia is also a reference to each of those carriers collectively (ie, Regence BlueShield, Regence BlueShield of Idaho, and Regence BlueCross BlueShield of Oregon)
Cambia does not have a formal plan to assess, reduce, or mitigate its emissions in its operations or organizations However, Cambia does have a formal sustainability program that seeks to incorporate the triple bottom line framework (economic growth, environmental stewardship, and social equity) into its planning, decision-making, and operations The sustainability program includes efforts to incorporate greater environmental stewardship into company operations Working with Cambias Real Estate and Facilities department, Information Technology (IT), and Human Resources, Cambia has undertaken the following efforts that will result in reduced greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions:
	Information Technology (IT): There are several efforts within Cambias IT infrastructure where technology and date center infrastructure changes have resulted in efficiencies directed at power, cooling, and space:
o	Major cooling upgrade to Salt Lake City data center
o	Switch to more efficient servers
o	Server virtualization
o	Mainframe consolidation
o	Increased data storage efficiencies
o	Replace firewall infrastructure with a more energy-efficient system
o	Replaced load balancer infrastructure with a more energy-efficient system
o	Upgraded our call center telephone system
o	Recycle eWaste though a BAN-certified eCycler
o	Shift to print on demand and double-sided paper
	Real Estate and Facilities:
o	Replaced aging HVAC system (boilers and chillers) with more energy efficient system
o	Established standardized HVAC temperature set points, to maximize unit efficiencies, which reduced energy consumption
o	Implemented daylight harvesting in Burlington, and implementing in locations when remodels occur
o	Changed lighting in Salem garage from sodium vapor to fluorescent
o	Received Energy Star certification in 2 locations (Burlington and Tacoma), tracking energy use in all locations through Energy Star
o	Contracting with a janitorial vendor that uses proprietary green cleaners and microfiber towels to reduce waste
o	Renovating and maintaining our office space through use of low VOC paints and carpets, purchasing products with recycled content, reusing materials and furniture where possible, recycling materials such as carpet
o	Conducting waste audits to assess the waste stream and identify opportunities to reduce waste and increase recycling 
	Human Resources
o	Reducing our actual footprint through telework and mobile work arrangements An estimated 20% of Cambia employees now work remotely This initiative has reduced/eliminated commutes for these employees with a commensurate reduction in emissions (We have not measured the reduced emissions or other environmental benefits of this shift to remote and mobile work) While we expect this effort to have decreased emissions, we recognized that there is some displacement of emissions to employees who are now lighting, heating, and cooling their homes during the day when they are working from home
o	Cambia has a strong commute reimbursement program that subsidizes public transit passes and carpooling
o	Cambia also has a strong bike commuter program that encourages employees to bike to work The bike commuter program provides support to all levels of riders such as beginning bike commuters through a bike buddy program, various bike-commuting workshops and a resource-rich Bike Commuters site on Spark, the company intranet Cambia participates in May Bike to Work Month and the Bike Commute Challenge in September

Berkley National Insurance Company," 
The company policy on risk management and investment management as regards climate change is summarized as:
	The Berkley Group has set an overall appetite level for catastrophe risk, and monitors itself against this regularly
	Catastrophe risk is a key consideration in the strategic management of the Group; any consideration of catastrophe risk, factors in the potential impact of climate change relative to our business plan
	Our Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) team investigates the latest scientific reports in respect of the potential impact of climate change in insured losses, and summarizes these for the ERM Committee
	The ERM and Catastrophe teams investigate the possibility of model miss within vendor catastrophe models; this includes a comparison of modeled industry losses against revalued historic losses, investigation of individual sub-components within the model, and stress testing model frequency and severity assumptions
	The Group uses the investigations of the ERM and Catastrophe teams to develop its own view of catastrophe risk This may differ from the view of the catastrophe modeling vendor, and in some instances may cause us to take a more conservative view of certain types of risk
	This own view of catastrophe risk is used both at a macro level, for assessing our overall exposures, and at a micro level, for assessing an individual location 
	The ERM and Catastrophe teams monitor the key catastrophe exposures for the overall Group and for each individual operating company  Each company receives data on its exposures and has been provided with mapping software developed specifically for the monitoring and modeling of catastrophes  This mapping software allows each company to identify its exposed limits by line of business and type of exposure (buildings, contents, business interruption), the number of locations, and the actual policies that are exposed in a particular area
	Each operating company includes within its business plan the catastrophe exposed limits they anticipate for the next year by region and county tier; the ERM and Catastrophe teams monitor each company against their planned aggregate over the course of each year
	The ERM team identifies to both senior management and to our operating companies those locations and policies which are most likely to give rise to a substantial loss from hurricane
	Both senior management and our operating companies are regularly provided with updates on the latest published articles and reports on climate change as part of our emerging issues weekly update report
	The Group restricts its investments in municipal bonds in areas that are most subject to catastrophic loss
	The ERM and Investment teams coordinate to monitor the Group exposure to municipal bonds in those states that are most likely to experience significant catastrophes
	When considering real estate purchases, the Investment team considers the exposure to catastrophe at that location  When there is a risk of catastrophe, the ERM team works with the Investment team to assess that risk, and this assessment is taken into consideration when determining whether to proceed with the purchase
Investment Management perspective, the companies look at: 
In the normal course of researching and performing due diligence on investment opportunities, the investment department assesses many different risk factors including (but not limited to) inflation, demographic shifts, economic trends, management issues, interest rates, consumer behavior, competitive forces,  credit risk, political risk, convexity risk, climate change, and others The investment department does not maintain specific policies for these risk factors but attempts to assess the impact that each of them will have on our ability to realize the desired rate of return that is modeled for each investment  For each type of investment, the relevant risk factors mentioned above will be subjected to sensitivity analysis to determine their relative impact on the expected returns Therefore, if one of the most relevant risk factors for a given investment opportunity was identified as climate change (an energy investment for example), then various scenarios would be run at different cost structures and revenue levels to assess the impact on operating margins as a result of changing energy consumption patterns, competitive pressures from substitute products, regulatory decisions, penalties and fees, lawsuits, changes in law, etc",1
Atlantic Specialty Insurance Company," Our Enterprise Risk Management Committee has conducted secondary research on climate risk We have reviewed research and literature from such sources as Munich Re and Swiss Re Our analysis and conclusions are that, while climate change may be an important factor, our ability to separate the effects of climate change from other, random factors in the insurance industry and physical environment and then respond in a proactive fashion is extremely limited",1
