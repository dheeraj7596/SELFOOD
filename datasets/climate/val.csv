Questions to consider include:
	For what perils does the company believe that future trends may deviate substantially from historical trends due to changes in the hazard? Similarly, for what perils, if any, does the company believe that a catastrophe model extrapolating observed trends would be insufficient to plan for maximum possible loss or yearly average loss? What steps has the company taken to model or analyze perils associated with non-stationary hazards?  We have not evaluated these future trends to date
	Has the company used catastrophe models to conduct hypothetical stress tests to determine the implications of a wide range of plausible climate change scenarios? We have not

North American Elite Insurance Company," Therefore, it is important that we also take a long-term view on the risk factors that may have an adverse impact on our portfolio, which includes climate change Hence, sustainability and climate change are essential topics for us Our asset management has a well-defined framework, which considers ESG criteria consistent with the Groups Code of Conduct, and has a commitment to sustainability The overall responsibility for sustainable investing lies with the Group Chief Investment Officer, supported by the Asset Management Investment Committee and the Asset Management Executive Team Furthermore, an ESG Advisory Group, formed by representatives of all investment units, legal, compliance and risk management, oversees and monitors the progress of our responsible investment activities and ensures that our commitment is reflected in our day-to-day activities

The Group Asset Management Responsible Investment Policy defines our commitment to sustainability The policy outlines in particular the principles for all responsible investing activities which include asset classes, investment manager selection, portfolio monitoring and reporting, voting (through the reference to the Swiss Re Voting Framework) and engagement

Swiss Re's strong commitment to sustainability is also defined in our Sustainability Risk Framework This framework enables us to identify and analyze potential ESG risks within an investment The framework consists of two umbrella policies on human rights and environmental protection, and seven policies on sensitive sectors or issues: the defense industry; oil and gas (including oil sands); mining; dams; animal testing; forestry and logging; pulp & paper and oil palm; and nuclear weapons proliferation Each policy contains a number of predefined criteria and qualitative standards that may lead to the exclusion of a company or a country from our investment scope Following a recent review, we extended our exclusion list to include companies potentially posing a significant reputational risk to investors due to controversial business activities from an ESG perspective Our Asset Management unit applies all mentioned criteria to our investment assets, and excludes companies and countries if they do not meet the pre-defined criteria and qualitative standards

Swiss Re is committed to investing its assets responsibly via a controlled and structured investment process, integrating environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria As part of our continuous improvement, we switched to benchmarks composed of higher ESG rated companies for our listed equity and corporate bond portfolios Thus, we apply sustainability related risk factors consistently along our entire investment process Material outcomes are incorporated into our investment decision making

As a long-term investor, we consider ESG factors that may have an adverse impact on the sustainable value of our portfolio, such as climate risk and carbon footprints For the systematic and regular integration of such ESG factors, we apply sustainability ratings to our investment portfolio As a result, we measure our exposure to carbon emissions in listed equities and corporate bonds in a systematic manner

For our rates product portfolio that mainly includes government bonds (incl agency), we have implemented a concept of minimum ESG rating standards at country level considering political risk, human rights, and environmental factors that affect the resilience of countries as part of our ESG practice Assessment results guide our responsible investment decisions to ensure the targeted ESG quality of our government bond portfolio The sustainability rating is of particular relevance from the perspective of climate change as it measures not only the overall social and governance situation in a country but also its environmental aspects This allows us to consider environmental management in any country in our investment strategy 

In 2017, Swiss Re's Asset Management receives the highest rating for its responsible investment approach (""Strategy & Governance"") the second year in a row Swiss Re scores among the top 15% of all signatories of the United Nations' Principles for Responsible Investments 

In Swiss Re's real estate investments, sustainability criteria play an essential role We apply ambitious sustainability standards For projects in Switzerland, the applicable criteria are defined in the Energy Mission Statement of Swiss Re This stipulates that all new buildings need to conform to the MINERGIE standard (wwwminergiech), a Swiss quality label specifying high levels of energy efficiency and superior user comfort When an existing building is due for renovation, this standard applies whenever it is feasible from an architectural, technical and financial point of view By the end of 2016, the combined value of our MINERGIE®-certified buildings reached USD 04 billion, or 22% of our Swiss portfolio of direct real estate investments The total energy consumption surface in accordance with the MINERGIE® standard was 82'497 m2 at the end of 2016 In addition, more than 59'000 m2 had been sold on to third parties

Since 2015, Swiss Re has also invested in the US real estate market The investment managers approach to sustainability includes GreenGuide: Sustainable Property Operations, a best practice guideline for sustainable and efficient real estate operations; ULI GreenPrint Foundation, a global environmental management platform; and LEED Certification from the US Green Building Council

At the end of 2016, approximately 44% of our investment portfolio was managed externally For more systematic and regular monitoring of the actual integration of ESG factors into this portfolio, we have engaged the services of a leading ESG research company This expert provides in-depth research, ratings and analysis of the environmental, social and governance-related business practices They assess our portfolios relative to traditional as well as tailored ESG benchmarks built up on the following criteria: 

	Environmental: Climate Change, Natural Resources Use, Waste Management and Environmental Opportunities;
	Social: Human Capital, Product Safety, Social Opportunities;
	Governance: Corporate Governance, Business Ethics, Government & Public Policy

Results are used to better understand the implications of incorporating ESG considerations into our investment decision-making process and to further improve the quality of our investment portfolio For that, we work closely with the external managers to ensure they consider these ESG aspects in their investment processes The managers individual performances are monitored in line with our Responsible Investment Policy, and they are required to report regularly on their responsible investment activities  The next step is to provide a deep-dive analysis on the portfolio's inherent carbon emissions to get detailed transparency and to better manage the risks and opportunities associated with climate change 

Furthermore, we actively contribute to a low carbon economy by investing in the growing SSA (sovereigns, supranationals and agencies) green bond market, primarily relying on the Green Bond Principles Moreover, as part of our commitment to sustainability, we invest in green bonds in our credit mandates, as well as renewables and social infrastructure in our infrastructure private debt mandates Debt raised through green bonds is used to finance environmental responsible projects that provide clear benefits from that perspective We are well advanced in meeting our investment target for green bonds of at least USD 15bn

In order to mitigate the risk of stranded assets, we have also adopted a policy to avoid investments in companies that generate 30% or more of their revenues from thermal coal mining or that use at least 30% thermal coal for power generation We divested from all related equity positions and the vast majority of our fixed income holdings

Furthermore, KP has: 1 joined RE100, a collaborative, global initiative uniting more than 100 influential businesses committed to 100 percent renewable electricity; 2 helped found the California Healthcare Climate Alliance, a collaborative of health care organizations, facilitated by the NGO Health Care Without Harm, to urge policymakers and climate action advocates to integrate health and healthcare considerations into the development and implementation of climate change policy; 3 joined the Ceres Business for Innovative Climate and Energy Policy coalition to promote responsible bi-partisan public policy; 4 signed onto the Ceres Connect the Drops campaign on water stewardship, a campaign that showcases the strong leadership of California companies and policymakers to advance water solutions that ensure sustainable management of the states stressed, and often unpredictable, water supplies

Alfa Mutual Insurance Company,"  Our focus is on analyzing weather data and models in detail to manage the risks posed by extreme weather events  We use hurricane and severe storm models to quantify weather risk and address it through underwriting, pricing and reinsurance decisions

Allstate Insurance Group," To better prepare for inevitable natural catastrophes, Allstate recommends an improved system of catastrophe preparedness and protection that is financially sound and organized to efficiently utilize the resources and expertise of private and public entities, including those of local, state, and federal governments Currently, a significant gap exists between the available coverage and necessary protection for major natural catastrophes because of the limited capacity of the private insurance and reinsurance sectors and the financial burden caused by these catastrophes

A national backstop for state catastrophe funds that is fully funded by a portion of private insurance premiums would increase the private insurance market's ability to respond to large-scale natural catastrophes The plan we support would not eliminate private reinsurance, which allows insurance companies to spread the risk of catastrophic losses and which is essential to the private insurance market Private reinsurers will continue to play an integral role in the insurance market, and private reinsurers will be encouraged to participate in providing capacity to the national backstop This plan would spread risk even more and provide a guaranteed source of reinsurance protection after major events or a series of events that could destabilize the market or even threaten a private market collapse
 
The plan we support will provide additional, needed capacity to the market, above and beyond what the private reinsurance market provides It will not eliminate private reinsurance; it will supplement it

Allstate specifically supports the Homeowners and Taxpayers Protection Act of 2013 (HR noi) because it includes the features of the plan we have discussed in these comments This legislation was drafted with input from experts in catastrophe management and actuarial science and improves upon similar legislation introduced in the past The sooner this legislation becomes law, the sooner and the better we can prepare and protect America from future natural catastrophes

Allstate also engages consumers and customers on the topic of disaster preparedness through vehicles like the Allstate Slog (http://blogallstatecom/), allstatecom (http://wwwallstatecom/tools-and-resources/be-aware-and-prepareaspx), and the distribution of disaster preparation and awareness brochures to customers by agency owners

Allstate is a member of and actively supports ProtectingAmericaorg ProtectingAmericaorg is a national coalition of more than 300 organizations representing emergency management experts, first responders, disaster relief agencies, non-profits, businesses, and insurers that believes that a comprehensive solution is needed to better prepare and protect America from future catastrophes

Allstate publicly discloses all identified climate related risks through the CDP annually

Please note that the Companies have approximately 20% of their total writings in Property and the remaining 80% of their total writings are for lines other than property; thus the business focus is on liability lines of insurance Additionally the Companies write almost entirely commercial lines risks rather than personal lines risks 

Perils considered when assessing the potential risks posed by climate change include:
	Hurricane and tropical storm
	Tornado
	Flood
	Drought
	Wildfire

Hurricane
North Atlantic hurricanes and tropical storms typically impact states between Texas and Maine  The Group identifies and models its hurricane risks in 23 states that could be affected by these perils, and on an annual basis has its exposures modeled in an alternative vendor model with a broader set of states

As noted in section 3, over the period from 1880 onwards there is a slight downward trend in the number of landfalling hurricanes  Some of the weather and climate conditions that make it easier for hurricanes to form in the Atlantic Basin also appear to impair the likelihood of landfall  For example, hurricanes that form further from land are less likely to maintain their structure long enough to make landfall as damaging events  In the long term the current consensus view is that there will be fewer hurricanes, but that these will be of greater intensity However the same science that provides this long term view also indicates it will be many decades before we see these changes

In a recent paper that discusses the short term (three to five years) impact of climate change on insured losses observes that climate change has had no measurable effect on the North Atlantic hurricanes that drive Cat Market losses Loss levels have gone up over time primarily due to increases in the value of building stock standing in the way of hurricanes These are the conclusions of the most recent report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change  [Climate Change and Hurricane Loss: Perspectives for Investors by Karen Clark and John Lummis June 2015]
The IPCC note in their  CLIMATE CHANGE 2013 : The Physical Science Basis: Frequently Asked Questions that Over periods of a century or more, evidence suggests slight decreases in the frequency of tropical cyclones making landfall in the North Atlantic and the South Pacific, once uncertainties in observing methods have been considered 

The Group closely monitors the forecast numbers of tropical storms and hurricanes for each season, investigates all available vendor models, and tests alternative assumptions on the potential frequency and severity of such events

Each individual property location is assessed for catastrophe risk, with particular focus on those nearest the coast and / or near river estuaries

Tornado
As noted in section 3, over the period from 1950 onwards the number of tornadoes is not increasing  In older calendar years there was significant under-reporting of the weakest category of tornado (EF-0); if one considers all other tornado strengths there is no trend in the frequency of these events or in the number falling into each strength category EF-1 to EF-5

When tornado insured losses are normalized for changes in exposures (for example, the number and values of the buildings and contents, often in areas that were previously agricultural land), these too show no increasing trend

The Group models tornado losses in every state within the USA, and has also revalued the tornadoes reported by the ISO Property Claims Service (PCS) from 1950 onwards to allow for changes in exposure as an additional data source  

Flood
As noted in section 3, flood losses arising from river and surface water are decreasing as a percentage of GDP  
The majority of the property policies issued by the Group exclude losses covered by flood  In those policies that do cover flood, many have flood sublimits

Drought & Wildfire
Drought and wildfire are strongly connected  One study looking at data through to 2002 indicated that fully half the variability in wildfire (measured by acres burned) arises as a result of drought conditions
(Fire and Drought, The Thoreau Institute, December 31, 2006) 

As noted in section 3, the current period of drought is not as severe as periods seen in the past  Furthermore, there was a drought in the latter part of the 16th century that was far more severe than any subsequent drought in North America

The Group does not write the two business lines that would be most significantly impacted by drought (crop multi-peril) or by wildfire (homeowners)  Consequently our losses arising from such events are minimal

Fidelity Fire & Casualty," AIR has examined the relationship between the annual landfall frequency and different climate signals, such as sea surface temperatures (SST) in the North Atlantic Many scientists believe that an increase in SST will lead to an increase in the frequency as well as intensity of landfalling hurricanes Estimates of the effect of SST on hurricane frequency can be obtained by comparing the number of landfalling hurricanes during years when SST has been warmer than average to the landfall frequency during the entire historical period since 1900 Considering the nature of Frontlines business and the location of the insured risk, the company finds this modeling useful in predicting the anticipated losses as well as estimating the amount of reinsurance it may need to acquire for an upcoming year These predictions are calculated on an annual basis",2

"Bravo Health Pennsylvania, Inc."," Additionally, increases in energy and fuel costs may result in broader inflationary pressures from our suppliers 

We manage risks associated with energy and fuel costs through
(1) our emissions reduction projects and 
(2) our tracking and monitoring on progress toward energy reduction targets    Our Global Real Estate (GRE) team considers this potential risk to inform decision on making on investments in emissions reduction projects In 2014, we completed 13 emissions reduction projects, which include lighting retrofits and replacements of aging infrastructure   We also manage this risk towards our emphasis on fleet efficiency - Cigna's vehicle fleet exceeds the national average fuel efficiencythe majority of our vehicles are 4-cylinder with alternative fuel (E85) capabilities and hybrid engines, and are classified as partial zero emissions vehicles  To manage progress against our 2017 emissions reduction targets, we utilize a proprietary technology data management portal and Utility Insight; a tool to aggregate data for all the sustainability program efforts The Utility tool provides a detailed dashboard of energy cost, consumption and variance across our real estate portfolio  in addition to Energy Star ratings  These management methods, most notably our investments in emissions reduction projects, have not reduced the likelihood of this risk, but they have reduced this risks potential magnitude over the next five years

Risk: Tropical cyclones (hurricanes and typhoons)-- Increases in the frequency and severity of extreme weather events, such as hurricanes and typhoons, could impact our business services distribution capacities, and may cause damage to physical assets  Cigna is committed to excellence in helping our customers enhance and extend their lives and protect their financial security Such a commitment requires that we be prepared to provide our services and offer our products virtually without fail    Cigna's Customer Disaster Response also may need to make temporary policy changes, such as waiving various medical requirements, refilling prescriptions and expanding its help line, to proactively address customer service issues and provide personal assistance and support for all affected by a disaster     Additionally, Cignas Employee Assistance Program (EAP) may open its telephone lines to offer members of the impacted communities access to trained clinicians via the telephonic EAP services, regardless if callers have Cigna EAP or not The EAP may also offer immediate access to on-site Critical Incident Services (CISD) support for Cigna clients

Management methods for the risk of tropical cyclones (hurricanes and typhoons) include the following:  
(1) Cignas Business Continuity Planning and Data Center Recovery plans sets forth procedures for data recovery, continuation of business functions and the use of supporting technology to recover critical business operations in the event of hurricanes and other unexpected disruptions The plans are updated and documented annually Cignas data center recovery plans are tested routinely with end-user evaluations of the restored systems as part of the testing protocol 

(2) Cignas critical applications run in hardened sites protected by an emergency generator Weve also repatriated core elements of our recovery capability including infrastructure to recover the top prioritized business functions and related computer applications through data and server replication

(3) To support clients, we have an online Disaster Resource Center, which is updated to offer resources specific to an area and incident Paired with an intimate knowledge of the provider network, Our Employee Assistance Consultant team area trained to respond quickly in the event of hurricanes

(4) We also obtain insurance and make investments to protect our facilities from hurricane risk   These management methods have not reduced the likelihood of this risk, however; we believe that these methods have reduced this risks potential magnitude over the next 1-3 years

Risk: Reputation--Corporate reputation on performance related to environmental responsibility, particularly on issues related to climate change, is increasingly important to our corporate clients as evidenced by the frequent occurrence of sustainability questions on RFPs for potential corporate clients and RFIs from existing ones   Also, our reputation on performance related to climate change issues is becoming increasingly important to our employees, investors and other stakeholders We will continue to monitor their key concerns and areas of greatest interest through stakeholder materiality assessments 

Management Method: Management methods include the following:  
(1) Within our Strategic Sustainability Performance Plan, we make continued emission reductions investments to support this energy strategy and 2017 emissions reduction targets

(2) The advancement of our Cigna Connects corporate responsibility framework across our organization supports our Strategic Sustainability Performance Plan by aligning and communicating our Corporate Responsibility initiatives 

(3) We closely monitor and respond to corporate client (including RFPs and RFIs) and investor requests related to climate change and corporate responsibility 

(4) We also engage stakeholders and employees to enhance continuous improvement in the implementation of sustainability This includes gathering data and operational experience from programs and sites, disseminating internal scorecards that provide feedback on progress towards goals and completing mandatory and voluntary external reports In 2014, Cignas published its first Corporate Responsibility Report using the GRIs G4 guidelines  We believe that  if Cigna did not engage in these current management methods - both the likelihood and magnitude of this risk over the next 1-3 years would be higher However, we acknowledge the importance of continuously improving and responding to evolving stakeholder concerns and expectations to reduce the likelihood and potential magnitude of this risk over the next 4-10 years

Climate change risk currently ranks lower on the risk spectrum when compared to liquidity, durations, interest rate, and asset class

Furthermore from an investment portfolio standpoint we believe any risks or opportunities associated with climate change, such as carbon and water restrictions, are generally priced into the cost of the investment through the market; any potential arbitrage opportunities would have imbedded investment risk which we believe to be inappropriate for us to take given our overall risk tolerance profile

Given the nature of our underwritten liability we do not currently assess the correlation between climate risks our underwriting and investments Due to the relative short-tailed liability associated with the health underwriting risk profile we believe it is not as critical as it would be for a life company, or P&C company, to structure our portfolio with a similar duration

Unum life Insurance Company of America,"  To summarize, they are:  
	Risks driven by changes in regulation
	Risks driven by changes in physical climate parameters
	Risks driven by changes in other climate-related developments

In our US operations, we have identified the following risks driven by changes in regulation:

Lack of regulation resulting in potential increased operational costs:  Future governmental emission programs either at the Federal, State or local level could impact our business Through trade organizations and other information sources, Unum keeps abreast of pending regulations that could impact our operations If a new regulation is implemented that impacts Unum, measures will be put into place to minimize the impact

1	Uncertainty surrounding new regulation resulting in potential increased capital costs:  As global transition to a low-carbon economy escalates, Unum will be required to comply with CC regulations as they are presented Compliance with regulations requires man-power and capital expenditure that would not have been required in absence of the regulation Unum Group owns four physical sites in four states, SC, ME, TN, and MA We operate these facilities utilizing green building best practices We are positioned to adopt new regulations when and if enacted Unum has a government relations department that stays abreast of federal and state issues relating to all topics, including climate change, and has positioned Unum to respond as regulations are being formulated and adopted

In our US operations, we have identified the following risks driven by physical climate parameters:
1	Change in mean (average) temperature resulting in potential increased operational costs:  This risk could cause an increased expense for utility consumption required for employee comfort in any of Unum's office buildings For example, in the Southeast, increases in temperatures caused by emissions will require additional cooling resulting in higher energy consumption to provide employee comfort while working Actions taken to address this potential risk include upgrade to our building systems to improve operational efficiency and lessen expenses

2	Other physical climate risk drivers which could potentially increase both capital and operational costs:  the CHA campus is subject to tornado and severe storm damage; and Portland and Worcester are subjected to winter weather Shifts in weather patterns has resulted in major weather events such as tornados and flooding that can result in major physical damage to infrastructure in any of our buildings For example, in 2011, our Chattanooga, TN campus narrowly escaped damage caused by one of the 27 tornadoes that touched down in the area The campus suffered minor damage from the storms but was not directly impacted

3	Uncertainty of physical risks which could potentially increase both capital and operational costs:  CC presents a plethora of weather-related risks as weather patterns become increasingly more severe and unpredictable These weather patterns present challenges as abnormal occurrences continue to materialize These uncertainties, including extremes in precipitation, droughts, increased snowfall and ice, rises in sea level, cyclones, etc are becoming more prevalent and require strategic planning, funding, and mitigation efforts

In our US operations, we have identified the following risks driven by other climate-related developments:
1	Reputation- which could potentially result in a reduced demand for our services:  Unum provides services to a large number of fortune 500 companies and receives inquiries from customers about our environmental programs and performance and also from State Commissioners Negative publicity may result in current and potential customers from conducting business with Unum

National union Fire Insurance company of Pittsburgh. Pa," A potential result of this may be an increase of claims and/or probabilistic risk exposure 

Operational Risks
AIG currently operates within the US and in over 80 countries in the Americas, Europe, Asia Pacific, Middle East, and Africa The company has facilities and physical assets that could be vulnerable to the impacts of climate change The areas with the greatest potential for catastrophe losses likely are the major metropolitan centers along the eastern and Gulf coasts of the US, as well as the urbanized areas and coastlines of other countries in which AIG has property insurance exposures Within the US, hurricanes pose the greatest catastrophic weather-related risk for AIG  

Other Risks 
Risks driven by changes in other climate-related developments may include: reputational risk associated with the publics perception of AIGs carbon performance; and changes to consumer behavior based on changed preferences for products and services At this time, AIG believes that these risks will not have a substantive impact on revenues, expenditures or business operations, but the company recognizes that they may shape future considerations and strategies

As a global financial services provider with a relatively small environmental footprint, AIG is not an energy intensive business, nor does AIG consume large amounts of natural resources for the operation of business AIG does not consider climate change related regulatory risks to be material at this time Nevertheless, current cap and trade schemes and carbon taxes do affect AIG operating expenses in some geographies For example, in the UK AIG complies with the Carbon Reduction Commitment

AIG will continue to monitor regulatory developments, such as fuel/energy limits, carbon taxes, cap and trade schemes, emission reporting obligations, and heightened energy efficiency standards, and will assess the potential impacts of these developments on AIGs business

American Bankers Life Assurance Company of FL," The Board's Finance and Risk Committee has oversight for enterprise risk management For our Global Housing business, our Reinsurance Risk Committee monitors catastrophe exposure monthly and reports results to the Finance and Risk Committee of the Board on a regular basis The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of our Board of Directors oversees our ESG efforts Our Chief Risk Officer, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer, who each report directly to our CEO, oversee functions responsible for climate-related actions, policies and risk mitigation and management
Our Chief Risk Officer leads Assurants global Office of Risk Management The Companys internal risk governance structure is headed by the Executive Risk Committee, which is chaired by our CEO and composed of our Chief Risk Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Legal Officer It is responsible for the strategic directive of the Companys enterprise risk management and provides updates to the Board The Enterprise Risk Management Committee (ERMC), which is chaired by our Chief Risk Officer and includes senior members of risk management and other areas of the Company, is responsible for the interdisciplinary oversight of business unit and enterprise risks and the design, management and recommendation of the risk appetite framework and limits The ERMC reports to the Executive Risk Committee and provides regular updates to the Companys Management Committee  
The ERMC works with four reporting sub-committees, which are each comprised of company subject matter experts and members of the risk management team:
(1) The Business Risk Committee is comprised of leaders from each line of business and each functional support area and meets monthly to focus on operational and strategic risks associated with new and existing business 
(2) The Finance and Investment Risk Committee focuses on Assurants exposure to financial and investment risks 
(3) The Reinsurance Risk Committee focuses on the insurance risk across the enterprise and approves the use of reinsurance to mitigate these risks
(4) The Insurance Risk Committee focuses on risks associated with our insurance products 
Our risk committees informally integrate social and environmental factors into their practices by monitoring relevant potential long-term concerns that could impact our business, such as climate change When the committees identify long-term risks, they work with other company functions to implement necessary programs and processes 
With exposure to natural catastrophe through our insured properties, Assurant maintains a high-quality panel of reinsurers, works with state regulators and incents physical risk management tools for flood-prone individuals Our reinsurance program reduces our financial exposure to climate change and enhances our ability to protect nearly three million homeowner and renter policyholders against severe weather and other hazards

Illinois Farmers Insurance Company,"  As an organization, Farmers recognizes that it is essential that we consider the impact we have on the environment, and that we create and foster a culture where all individuals are aware of opportunities to conserve energy and natural resources

We have initiatives in process that reduce our carbon footprint  These include changes in the way we manage our facilities, our fleet, and our travel 

Our goal is to purchase energy in an efficient, cost effective and environmentally responsible manner, and to establish and implement effective energy management programs

Our facility in Caledonia, MI, has replaced existing HID parking lot and road lights with more energy efficient LED lighting, and reduced the number of light heads on poles These LED fixtures are typically 50% - 75% more energy efficient and have a useful life of 72,000 hours (82 years with 24/7 use) There will be continued energy savings with projected carbon savings over the next 10 years of 2,145 tonnes CO2 In 2015 we have installed the same energy efficient lighting in Lake Mary, FL, which will result in continued energy reduction saving in Kilowatt usage per year 59,900 kWh/yr In 2014 we replaced all of the parking lot lighting in our LEED certified Oklahoma City, OK facility with LED  Net energy savings is 133,634 kilowatts/yr  We also replaced the Lobby lighting, workstation lighting, and display case lighting with LED  We have previously installed a new Cool Roof product at one of our facilities and have installed solar panels in two other locations  We continue to implement electrical power conservation programs in multiple operations  In some locations we have installed motion sensitive light switches and energy saving light bulbs (such as ALTO lights from Phillips, which are recognized by the industry as energy-efficient lighting solutions) In Austin, TX we have converted our 190,000 sq ft office and also our 9,000 sq ft office in McAllen, TX over to 100% green electricity through electricity provider contracts  We will continue to look for additional opportunities, where available In Grand Rapids, MI we have replaced (4) 25+ year old elevators with more energy efficient elevators which are projected to save $5,000 annually in electricity costs  In addition to these improvements, we have also implemented programs to remind employees to power down equipment when it is not in use  Many computer monitors and desktop computers are automatically set to go into a sleep or hibernation mode after a short period of inactivity

Depending on job assignment, employees may be provided with a company fleet vehicle  Since 2010, more fuel efficient vehicles have been purchased for the company fleet, mid-sized sedans are being used instead of full-size sedans, hybrid vehicles have been added to the fleet and the overall fleet size has been reduced Nearly 258,000 less gallons of fuel were purchased (75% reduction) between 2016 and 2017

As many Farmers employees commute to our business locations, we encourage ridesharing and the use of public transportation  In some locations, we provide incentives including subsidies for train passes, bus passes and vanpools, free shuttle buses from train stations, and preferred carpool parking spaces  Farmers has also installed five electric charging stations  at two facilities in California to provide an energy source for those employees who already drive electric vehicles and to also encourage more environmentally friendly vehicle use 

Telepresence technology and high quality HD video conferencing systems in many operations have helped minimize airline travel   

In addition to our focus on the reduction of emissions we have made improvements in our effort to reduce water consumption  Improvements include low volume sink faucets, low volume toilets, and waterless urinals  Other improvements within our operations include upgrades to programmable irrigation systems and pop-up sprinkler heads, which eliminate leakage and overspray  We have also transitioned to xeriscape in some locations

We continue to work on reducing utilization of paper and office supplies  Copier/printer machines in     many of our locations are set for duplex (two-sided) printing and the print/copy default has been set to black and white vs color   Farmers has implemented an MDS optimization program within Document Logistics, replacing multi-functional devises with more energy efficient equipment This program was put into place not only to reduce energy consumption and the impact on the environment, but to also ensure cost savings We are in the third year of the program and continue to reduce both the number and size of the multifunction devices (MFD) in our facilities  Through YE 2016 we have reduced the number of multifunction devices (MFD) from 3,329 to 1,401 (58% reduction)  Replacement machines are right sized and more energy efficient  The overall result is a 2,068,445 lb (73%) reduction in CO2 emissions and a 1,313,100 kWh (71%) reduction in electricity usage over the 3 year period

Virtually all employee communications are handled electronically rather than through paper  As of 2011, semi-monthly statements of employee earnings and deductions have been electronically available and are no longer printed and mailed to employees  Improved ordering processes have lowered the volume of consumable supplies in many locations  Recycling programs have been implemented for paper, plastic, cardboard and glass  Printer, copier ink and toner cartridges are also recycled, as are cell phones, chargers and obsolete electronic equipment such as computers and monitors  In our mail rooms, we have begun recycling and reusing packing materials for shipping  
 
We have implemented initiatives that provide customers with environmentally friendly choices that also reduce the organizations carbon footprint For example, in some operations, mail sent to agents and customers is delivered in envelopes made of recycled material  A new billing system available in some states and for some products provides increased on-line billing and payment capabilities  In some states and for some products, we are working to provide customers with the option to receive electronic policy forms and notices from us, rather than paper copies  Customers with these electronic policies may also have the option to receive bills, pay bills, and view their billing histories online  Some states prohibit the use of paperless communication with policyholders, which limits our ability to consider paperless options

Our MultiCar auto policy, available in some states, can cover multiple vehicles on one policy, thereby reducing the amount of paper customers receive and our overall carbon footprint

In 2010, Farmers built a 164,000 SF facility in Oklahoma City that was recognized by the US Green Building Council as qualifying for Core and Shell LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) certification at the silver level, and also qualified for LEED certification for the Tenant Improvement portion of the project  1400 employees moved into the building in October 2010 and continue to work there today

In some of our larger facilities: 1) ice and water machines are provided, reducing plastic bottled water consumption; 2) programmable thermostats are in place; 3) carbon footprint studies and energy audits have been completed; 4) Energy Star equipment is purchased whenever practical; 5) cleaning hours were revised to allow for more daytime cleaning, allowing us to deactivate interior lights earlier in the evening; 6) new employees are informed of our green business practices during their initial training classes and existing employees receive regular electronic communications on various energy-related topics, keeping awareness at a high level 7) In 2016 our large facility in Washington started a composting program as part of its waste services in the café and all kitchenettes  

In addition the two Print and Distribution Centers in North America have implemented several significant initiatives to mitigate impacts to the environment including: aggressive approach to deliver agent, customer and broker documents electronically versus traditional USPS mail;  On-line report viewing; purchasing of envelopes and stationary manufactured with paper from trees harvested from forests that are SFI (Sustainable Forestry Initiative) certified, Print-On-Demand of agent support materials versus warehoused stored materials; digitizing as much in-bound mail as possible via an active imaging approach; implemented many initiatives improving efficiency, lowering energy consumption, actively participating in operational recycling program, consolidating operations to a  two-site COE model and reducing operational waste from 4% to less than 2%",0

Truck Insurance Exchange," We publish materials for agents and customers that provide information about tornado and hurricane safety, fire safety and disaster recovery We also make home inventory materials available, which customers may use to establish a record of their belongings Some of these publications are available in other languages

Some of our officers are involved with organizations that have interests that intersect, or overlap with, the interests of organizations that focus on climate change Examples are the Institute for Business and Home Safety (IBHS), the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety and the Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety For example, IBHS works to reduce the social and economic effects of natural disasters and other property losses by conducting research and advocating improved construction, maintenance and preparation practices

We are also actively pursuing opportunities to assist our customers while also ensuring that issues such as wildfire risk remains visible to customers In 2021 Farmers will begin a pilot with a 3rd party vendor to provide wildfire mitigation services to customers in California (at no cost) Its our hope that this effort will educate customers on fortifying their homes against wildfire while also improving protection during these events

Some experts believe that climate changes have the potential to affect the frequency and severity of wildfire Fire, by emitting greenhouse gases and aerosols, is also thought to contribute to overall global warming Some researchers predict that in temperate regions, including the western United States, higher temperatures will extend wildfire seasons, with more occurring earlier and later in any given year Farmers is active in multiple fire safety, prevention and training boards These include the California State Board of Fire Services, which provides a forum for addressing fire protection and prevention issues We also participate in the Fire Safe Council, which provides resources for establishing and maintaining local Councils, and the Fire Safety Institute, which focuses on providing quality firefighter training and promoting firefighter safety",5
A.Central Insurance Company," Since NYCM solely writes in New York State, the geographical area most affected would be Long Island (Nassau and Suffolk counties) Special consideration has been given to distance to shore to control our exposure on shorelines We have now seen catastrophic events shift to the north due to a greater frequency of flood related events , and anticipate that this trend may continue Risks may then shift in exposure to regions of the state and lines of business (automobile insurance, commercial business interruption) where, historically, we have not been impacted  For several years, we have actively examined our geographic spread of property exposures, through RMS and AIR modeling, to ensure we manage concentration of risk related to climate change

Esurance Property and Casualty Insurance Company," To better prepare for inevitable natural catastrophes, Allstate recommends an improved system of catastrophe preparedness and protection that is financially sound and organized to efficiently utilize the resources and expertise of private and public entities, including those of local, state, and federal governments Currently, a significant gap exists between the available coverage and necessary protection for major natural catastrophes because of the limited capacity of the private insurance and reinsurance sectors and the financial burden caused by these catastrophes

A national backstop for state catastrophe funds that is fully funded by a portion of private insurance premiums would increase the private insurance market's ability to respond to large-scale natural catastrophes The plan we support would not eliminate private reinsurance, which allows insurance companies to spread the risk of catastrophic losses and which is essential to the private insurance market Private reinsurers will continue to play an integral role in the insurance market, and private reinsurers will be encouraged to participate in providing capacity to the national backstop This plan would spread risk even more and provide a guaranteed source of reinsurance protection after major events or a series of events that could destabilize the market or even threaten a private market collapse

The plan we support will provide additional, needed capacity to the market, above and beyond what the private reinsurance market provides It will not eliminate private reinsurance; it will supplement it

Allstate specifically supports the Homeowners and Taxpayers Protection Act of 2013 (HR noi) because it includes the features of the plan we have discussed in these comments This legislation was drafted with input from experts in catastrophe management and actuarial science and improves upon similar legislation introduced in the past The sooner this legislation becomes law, the sooner and the better we can prepare and protect America from future natural catastrophes

Allstate also engages consumers and customers on the topic of disaster preparedness through vehicles like the Allstate Blog (http://blogallstatecom/), allstatecorn (http://wwwallstatecom/tools-and-resources/be-aware-and-prepareaspx), and the distribution of disaster preparation and awareness brochures to customers by agency owners

Allstate is a member of and actively supports ProtectingAmericaorg ProtectingAmericaorg is a national coalition of more than 300 organizations representing emergency management experts, first responders, disaster relief agencies, non-profits, businesses, and insurers that believes that a comprehensive solution is needed to better prepare and protect America from future catastrophes

Main Street America Protection Insurance Company,"  Several enterprise risks are impacted by climate risk  Some of these are catastrophe, business interruption, capital adequacy, liquidity, underwriting, and reinsurer availability  The risk identification discussions identify new and evolving risks that may be components of the risk categories listed or new risks  ERM division personnel participate in several networking and professional organizations in order to ensure identification of risks on the horizon, within the insurance industry or across all industries  

As part of risk quantification, American Familys group of companies uses an economic capital model to evaluate these risks and ensure that sufficient capital exists to meet our obligations to our policyholders in the event of unlikely, extreme (or tail) event scenarios such as an investment or natural catastrophe event  

ERM monitors extreme catastrophe model events that are beyond what the organization has experienced in its history to ensure it understands the impacts to capital, claim handling, reinsurance and other resources from extreme events  The division also performs catastrophe stress scenario testing that considers weather related catastrophes that are more extreme than experienced historically

Continential Life Insurance Company," As a US-based insurance benefits corporation, Aetna does not produce products or services that lead directly to the emissions of substantial amounts of greenhouse gases or other pollutants Impact Aetna considers the impact to be additional costs associated with regulatory compliance Timeframe Aetna is uncertain when additional regulatory requirements would be required; however, best guess would be sometime within 6-10 years additional requirements would start to phase in  Direct/Indirect Aetna considers itself indirectly exposed to regulatory risks related to greenhouse gas emissions Likelihood of impact Aetna assumes the likelihood of increased regulatory requirements occurring as about as likely as not (between 33% and 66% probability) Magnitude of impact Given the impact of previous environmental regulations, Aetna believes the magnitude of the impact to the company to be low	Increased operational cost	Un-known	Indirect (Supply chain)	More likely than not	Low
The following are the (i) the potential financial implications of the risk before taking action; (ii) the methods you are using to manage this risk and (iii) the costs associated with these actions:

i) the potential financial implications of the risk before taking action:
As a US-based insurance benefits corporation, Aetna does not produce products or services that lead directly to the emissions of substantial amounts of greenhouse gases or other pollutants Thus, any regulations addressing climate change will not directly impact our products and services Rather, changes in environmental laws and regulations, whether inside and/or outside the US, are likely to impact Aetna's cost of doing business indirectly in the form of higher utility costs Aetna leases the vast majority of its office locations and expects that any changes in governmental policy concerning climate change will likely impact power generation (ie, utility) companies, which can be expected to pass on those costs to commercial landlords and other property owners which, in turn, can be expected to pass on those costs to commercial tenants, such as Aetna, over time
The scarcity of wood and wood pulp products may impact Aetna in any new construction project it might in the future undertake and would also impact the cost of office supply products, such as printer paper Other raw materials may also become scarcer or more expensive in the future due to the energy cost associated with their manufacture (eg, plastic) Those in our value chain will be similarly impacted through higher energy costs associated with their operations Aetna's vendors and suppliers will face higher overhead costs in the form of energy use and, where relevant, the cost of manufacture of certain items, and will be forced to pass those costs on to Aetna and other customers  Aetna will be indirectly impacted by increased costs for our suppliers and vendors Aetna's vendors and suppliers will face higher overhead costs in the form of energy use and, where relevant, the cost of manufacture of certain items, and will be forced to pass those costs on to Aetna and other customers Aetna will be indirectly impacted by increased costs for our suppliers and vendors
(ii) The methods we are using to manage this risk:  
At our corporate headquarters in Connecticut and in a few additional locations, Aetna possesses a modest amount of fuel burning equipment in order to handle power generation and business continuity needs in an emergency power outage situation We purchase low sulfur fuel for this equipment and would expect that any laws or regulations regarding the use of, and emissions from, this fuel burning equipment would impact Aetna directly However, based on past experience we would expect the activation and use of this fuel burning equipment to be an infrequent occurrence To help manage risks associated with a potential scarcity of office materials, Aetna has in place comprehensive recycling programs We use environmentally friendly paper for the printing of marketing materials, an effort that in 2012 helped save 302 tons of paper, and we recycle paper, carcboard, glass and plastic bottles Aetna has recycled fluorescent light bulbs since 1994, long before it was required

(iii) the costs associated with these actions:
Aetna has been unable to forecast the impact increased climate change regulation would have on our cost vs that from normal supplier variation (again, indirect costs) As discussed elsewhere (see Section 11, Energy elsewhere in this response) Aetnas energy costs, which are a direct cost, are integrated into annual budgets Any increase in fuel costs would need to be accounted for by the affected using department(s)

The following are descriptions of (i) the potential financial implications of the risk before taking action; (ii) the methods you are using to manage this risk; and (iii) the costs associated with these actions:

i) The potential financial implications of the risk before taking action:
As a US-based insurance benefits corporation, with an owned corporate headquarters in Connecticut and leased space throughout the US and internationally, we consider our company to be exposed to physical risks As a geographically diverse organization with workers located throughout the US and several overseas locations, Aetna is exposed to the physical risks of climate change The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (""IPCC"") describes an accelerating transition to a warmer globe marked by more extreme temperatures and extreme weather events (eg, increases in the frequency and severity of cyclone and hurricane activity) Specifically, in light of these predictions, Aetna's offices in Florida and along the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic seaboard potentially may be impacted by increased hurricane activity Aetna maintains these and other offices in support of our customers and to maintain a local market presence
(ii) The methods we are using to manage this risk:
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (""IPCC"") describes an accelerating transition to a warmer globe marked by more extreme temperatures and extreme weather events (eg, increases in the frequency and severity of cyclone and hurricane activity) While some of the IPCC's scientific work has been called into question by some, there is evidence to suggest at least more variability in the world's weather - a phenomenon that has been called ""global weirding""  In light of all of these predictions, Aetna's offices in Florida and along the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic seaboard potentially may be impacted by increased hurricane activity Aetna maintains these and other offices in support of our customers and to maintain a local market presence Aetna already has plans in place to respond to emergencies and other potential physical risks Our emergency and business continuity plans exist to ensure that Aetna is able to serve its customers without interruption regardless of natural or other disaster Aetna continues to evaluate its office location decisions based on the needs and location of our customers, the cost of doing business at a given site and other variables including the possibility of an extreme weather event which may impact our operations in that location  Aetna, as well as many of its vendors, customers and suppliers in Aetna's value chain are located in geographically diverse locations that might be impacted by these risks  We 
consider our company as well as those in our value chain to be exposed to physical risks
Aetna already has plans in place to respond to emergencies and other potential physical risks Our emergency and business continuity plans exist to ensure that Aetna is able to serve its customers without interruption regardless of natural or other disaster
(iii) the costs associated with these actions:
Aetna continues to evaluate its office location decisions based on the needs and location of our customers, the cost of doing business at a given site and other variables including the possibility of an extreme weather event which may impact our operations in that location If Aetna and others in its value chain experience these kinds of events, then the cost of doing business is likely to increase for all Aetna has been unable to determine if these costs would increase substantially over what is currently spent
We do not expect our company to be exposed to risks driven by changes in other climate-related developments that have the potential to generate a substantive change to our business operations, revenue or expenditure for the following reasons:

Aetna has been unable to determine what other climate change related risks it would be exposed to, especially those generating a substantive change to business operations Aetna constantly monitors impact drivers to its business and has determined that those directly impacting its health care business need the most attention at the current time
Aetna has been monitoring climate change legislation and regulation over the past decades and has not been able to determine if political leadership has any better idea of what will happen than Aetna does It appears that any legislation that will occur, notwithstanding political posturing, will be slow in materializing If so, this allows Aetna time to adapt its existing business processes to account for any changes at that time

The risk management process with regard to climate change risks and opportunities covers business units and affiliates with equity assets and investments that emit, or are indirectly responsible for GHG emissions, or that sequester or avoid GHG emissions as a result of their business operations

As part of their annual reporting, Business Unit Environmental Officers are required to report on regulatory and physical risks and opportunities that may affect their operations as a result of climate change  This reporting includes significant financial implications if there are any  On a quarterly basis, Business Unit Environmental Officers must report any significant environmental issues as part of the enterprise risk reporting cycle  Where appropriate, business units also report annually their GHG emissions data, which are consolidated at the company level for analysis and reporting  We report externally through Manulifes Public Accountability Statement, submissions to the CDP (formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project) and Dow Jones Sustainability Index, and various other reports throughout the year

At the company-level the Chief Environmental Officer is responsible for identifying the risks and opportunities associated with climate change This is done through regular monitoring of regulatory developments, and their current and potential impact on corporate operations We also participate in a number of associations such as the United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative (UNEP FI), the Principles for Responsible Investment and the Geneva Association, which provide access to knowledge related to climate risk and opportunities relevant to our sector

Climate change could increase the frequency and severity of weather-related disasters and pandemics, impact reinsurers and may affect the value of investments, including real estate In addition, regulation could affect the prospects of securities held, or the willingness to continue to hold these securities Environmental concerns spur scientific inquiry which may reposition the relative attractiveness of certain energy-generation sources over others The transportation industry may shift to alternative modes of conveyance resulting in a change in relevance Evaluating these and other possible environmentally focused transitions is part of keeping long-term promises to customers

Prudential has found opportunities to help mitigate climate change in a variety of asset classes Most prominently, the company has invested in renewable energy, green bonds and green real estate PGIM Fixed Income began investing in green bonds in 2013 Green bonds are debt instruments used to finance environmental initiatives such as renewable energy efficiency projects The market value of Prudentials green bonds totaled more than $1573 million at the end of 2017 As of December 31, 2017, PGIM Real Estate managed 267 million square feet of LEED certified US real estate totaling $139 billion Global certifications totaled $171 billion covering 334 million square feet

In addition, to continue driving more awareness around the benefits from risk mitigation, Nationwide is implementing a new endorsement focused on replacing roofs according to the different IBHS standards at the time of an eligible loss which will result in a more extreme weather-proofed roof  IBHS guidance for mitigating property losses is available directly to the public at wwwdisastersafetyorg 
Increased risk sharing through the utilization of wind/hail deductibles is also being implemented to help encourage consumers to proactively mitigate weather claims  In addition, Nationwide is active at the local and national level to help drive the necessary building code changes to make homes safer  
As catastrophe risk increases in certain markets, Nationwide continues to invest in the necessary tools to better understand the risk, whether it be hurricanes, severe thunderstorms or wildfires  Financially, the importance of geographic diversification within Nationwides portfolio is one of the key levers to being a successful property insurer  Included within this work is the integration of risk management findings into pricing, product development and distribution planning along with consumer education
Along similar lines, Nationwide constructed one of the first ever commercial buildings in San Antonio that is certified as fortified according to IBHS standards  The company continues to not only help drive these type of changes within the community but across the different businesses  In partnership with home builders, banks, consumers, IBHS and legislatures, the necessary changes will need to occur leading to improvements in building codes and risk management in general
From a commercial standpoint, Nationwide provides education and loss control services to assist customers in identifying risks, ways to mitigate risks along with including exclusionary language for certain risk types within its contracts  Through individual risk pricing modifications, those consumers who respond to these services in a positive manner could be eligible for improved pricing considerations

We manage risks associated with energy and fuel costs through
(1) our emissions reduction projects and 
(2) our tracking and monitoring on progress toward energy reduction targets    Our Global Real Estate (GRE) team considers this potential risk to inform decision on making on investments in emissions reduction projects In 2015 Cigna completed three projects to enhance the energy efficiency of HVAC and mechanical systems in our domestic real estate portfolio    We also manage this risk towards our emphasis on fleet efficiency - Cigna's vehicle fleet exceeds the national average fuel efficiencythe majority of our vehicles are 4-cylinder with alternative fuel (E85) capabilities and hybrid engines, and are classified as partial zero emissions vehicles  To manage progress against our 2017 emissions reduction targets, we utilize a proprietary technology data management portal and Utility Insight; a tool to aggregate data for all the sustainability program efforts The Utility tool provides a detailed dashboard of energy cost, consumption and variance across our real estate portfolio  in addition to Energy Star ratings  These management methods, most notably our investments in emissions reduction projects, have not reduced the likelihood of this risk, but they have reduced this risks potential magnitude over the next five years

Management methods for the risk of tropical cyclones (hurricanes and typhoons) include the following:  
(1) Cignas Business Continuity Planning and Data Center Recovery plans sets forth procedures for data recovery, continuation of business functions and the use of supporting technology to recover critical business operations in the event of hurricanes and other unexpected disruptions The plans are updated and documented annually Cignas data center recovery plans are tested routinely with end-user evaluations of the restored systems as part of the testing protocol 

(2) Cignas critical applications run in hardened sites protected by an emergency generator Weve also repatriated core elements of our recovery capability including infrastructure to recover the top prioritized business functions and related computer applications through data and server replication

(3) To support clients, we have an online Disaster Resource Center, which is updated to offer resources specific to an area and incident Paired with an intimate knowledge of the provider network, Our Employee Assistance Consultant team area trained to respond quickly in the event of hurricanes

(4) We also obtain insurance and make investments to protect our facilities from hurricane risk   These management methods have not reduced the likelihood of this risk, however; we believe that these methods have reduced this risks potential magnitude over the next 1-3 years

Risk: Reputation--Corporate reputation on performance related to environmental responsibility, particularly on issues related to climate change, is increasingly important to our corporate clients as evidenced by the frequent occurrence of sustainability questions on RFPs for potential corporate clients and RFIs from existing ones   Also, our reputation on performance related to climate change issues is becoming increasingly important to our employees, investors and other stakeholders We will continue to monitor their key concerns and areas of greatest interest through stakeholder materiality assessments 

Management Method: Management methods include the following:  
(1) Within our Strategic Sustainability Performance Plan, we make continued emission reductions investments to support this energy strategy and 2017 emissions reduction targets

(2) The advancement of our Cigna Connects corporate responsibility framework across our organization supports our Strategic Sustainability Performance Plan by aligning and communicating our Corporate Responsibility initiatives 

(3) We closely monitor and respond to corporate client (including RFPs and RFIs) and investor requests related to climate change and corporate responsibility 

(4) We also engage stakeholders and employees to enhance continuous improvement in the implementation of sustainability This includes gathering data and operational experience from programs and sites, disseminating internal scorecards that provide feedback on progress towards goals and completing mandatory and voluntary external reports Cigna has just published its third Corporate Responsibility Report using the GRIs G4 guidelines  We believe that  if Cigna did not engage in these current management methods - both the likelihood and magnitude of this risk over the next 1-3 years would be higher However, we acknowledge the importance of continuously improving and responding to evolving stakeholder concerns and expectations to reduce the likelihood and potential magnitude of this risk over the next 4-10 years

ACE Property and Casualty," Our analysis of the impact of various risks ranges from the known, based on definitive historical loss experience, to the hypothetical, where we use a calculation called probable maximum loss (PML) that relies on modeling based on various assumptions Risks are evaluated at least annually at three governance levels, with the companys senior management actively engaged in each The companys Risk and Underwriting Committee, product boards and risk-related committees meet as frequently as monthly to evaluate specific risks and risk accumulations in Chubbs business activities and investments, while the Board of Directors Risk and Finance Committee meets regularly with company management Regarding the potential effects of catastrophe losses, we continue to closely monitor our catastrophe risk accumulation around the world In addition, we use catastrophe modeling packages reliant upon meteorology and engineering assumptions to simulate and estimate hurricane losses 

Since the insurance products that we provide clients around the world may provide coverage for all of the risks noted, there are potential financial implications for Chubb The extent of potential negative implications depends on whether the loss is covered by the policy's terms and conditions and whether the underlying assumptions modeled in determining the pricing of the policy adequately reflect the potential risk If the model used to price coverage proves faulty or doesn't anticipate the potential magnitude of these risks in the future, then losses paid could exceed premiums collected, causing the company to draw a higher amount from its loss reserve pool that is set aside to pay future claims Conversely, if actual loss experience is lower than anticipated, positive adjustments could be made to reserve levels, producing a financial gain for the company If losses are not covered by Chubbs policies, or if the losses are within the assumptions used to price the coverage, then there would be no adverse financial implications for Chubb

BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY SPECIALTY INSURANCE COMPANY," Its focus on personal lines insurance, which can be evaluated for the impact of climate change on a very rapid basis, means that its operational functionality is its most important concern

General Reinsurance Company believes that its commercial, residential, and marine property classes may be at risk because of climate change  Unanticipated and adverse changes in the frequency or severity of natural catastrophes likely means that actual losses will exceed pricing assumptions  Casualty classes may be at risk due to ""parameter"" risk, for example, unanticipated changes in litigation trends or exposures, such as liability claims from persons or groups allegedly harmed by climate change and the potentially responsible parties responsible for that change  It is also conceivable, although not presently anticipated, that acute forms of climate change could result in pandemics or other life/health exposures  All of these factors could impact pricing assumptions relative to actual results

National Indemnity Company reinsurance operations have a large financial impact for the Group, but have a very small operational footprint, and can easily adapt to the impact of climate changes The underwriting philosophy is already conservative for reinsurance related to risks that could be impacted by weather or climate change scenarios, and can quickly be adapted to any climate change or perceived claimant situations 

The smaller insurance companies within the Group have smaller premium volumes and smaller physical operations, and therefore present less exposure to the Group as a whole should climate changes ultimately impact either their operations or their underwriting However, smaller operations are also better positioned to make changes in both their operations and underwriting on a more rapid basis should unpredicted climate related changes impact them Each subgroup will be continually alert to the risks associated with climate change

Humana Insurance Company," As our business evolves to respond to healthcare reform in the United States  through integrated healthcare delivery and operational cost reductions  we are transforming our business strategy to be more agile and responsive to current healthcare trends For example: strategically selecting and managing our changing real estate portfolio of office properties and associated services (such as data centers), expanding our number of medical clinics, and other new facility concepts are core to our success in responding to changing market demands and to the impacts of climate change We have invested staff resources and capital funds to manage risks and opportunities presented by the rising costs of fossil fuel-based energy and to improve building energy efficiency 

Addressing and collecting data on energy usage and intensity in these facilities supports our greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction goals We have committed that by the end of 2022, Humana will achieve a 21%YOY decrease (cumulative 105%) in greenhouse gas emissions from 2017 baseline emissions across our portfolio of owned and leased properties under direct Humana control This goal utilizes the suggested annual reduction based on CDPs science-based target methodology, however is considered a bridge goal due to the shorter target timeframe We support our goals by collecting data on building energy efficiency and green building features when considering new spaces to purchase or lease

To this end, Humana prioritizes support given to energy and emissions reduction projects Humana initiated several large-scale lighting retrofit projects in 2016-2019 at our largest owned facilities, which are projected to reduce annual energy costs by $1,080,200 We continued to upgrade lighting in 2020 that will save an additional $82,905 per year, for a total annual savings of $1,162,295 going forward In addition, our design standards team, architect and engineering consultants, and facilities team collaborated in 2016 to develop a comprehensive set of design standards for office and clinical operations to ensure consistency, energy efficiency, and sustainable practices across new builds and renovations We are also exploring renewable energy options to determine opportunity and feasibility 

We have also reduced our carbon footprint through increased efficiency of our heating and air conditioning systems and software settings that turns off personal computers when theyre not being used

Humana collaborates with internal and external partners to make joint decisions on data center projects to ensure the strategic use of funds that also provide sufficient returns in terms of energy efficiency We have worked with our equipment partners, done extensive modelling of air flow and cooling loads, and are implementing optimization strategies to minimize the cost of cooling and reduce the temperature differential required, while maintaining the reliability and performance of our data center equipment For example, our IT and Facilities Management teams collaborated to install new building management systems (BMS) at the data centers These systems provide visibility into energy efficiency opportunities such as upgrades to lithium batteries and the addition of smart tiles to enhance the BMS system by monitoring air flows not just at the cabinet level, but also at the overall level We have installed the Tridium system in the Louisville Data Center and are strategically allocating capital funds to pursue projects at the Simpsonville Data Center  As part of these efforts, in collaboration with Enterprise Associate and Business Solutions, IT, and our facilities management vendor, we have achieved Energy Star certification for both of our data centers

A team of internal and external specialists, coordinated by the Sustainability & Operations Manager, provides expertise on opportunities to reduce costs and emissions through operational efficiency and employee engagement on sustainability  In order to identify appropriate goals related to climate impact, and to track progress toward them, Humana calculates and publicly reports Scope 1, Scope 2, and Scope 3 emissions in accordance with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol In 2020, we undertook a more robust Scope 3 assessment to more fully evaluate our impacts along the value chain; this effort will also support our ongoing goal-setting work The company provides transparency into our goals and progress by voluntarily reporting to CDP and the Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI), in addition to producing a publicly-available Corporate Social Responsibility report

Humanas Workplace Solutions and Business Continuity teams are part of Humanas first line of defense in terms of the companys ERM governance structure For example, the Workplace Solutions team has responsibility for assessing risk and opportunities related to energy and greenhouse gas emissions reductions, while the Business Continuity team has responsibility for assessing risks related to catastrophes such as extreme weather events that may impact operations

Humana regularly reviews the ongoing risks and opportunities related to energy and climate impacts, and other environmental sustainability topics of material nature to Humanas business and its stakeholders As part of the periodic ERM updates with the ERMC and the Audit Committee, Humana conducts an exercise to identify and assess its top enterprise risks, as well as other material and relevant enterprise risks, which may encompass climate change related risks and opportunities As part of this activity, the ERM team facilitates discussions with risk owners to review and assess these enterprise risks This exercise is intended to consider both conventional and emerging risks Once these assessments have been completed, the results are summarized and presented to the ERMC and the Audit Committee This process allows for various levels of management to review and provide feedback on the assessments of potential risk impacts, risk velocity, risk mitigation efforts, and risk management maturity

Financial scenario analyses are then conducted for identified risks to determine priority and significance in relation to other risks This list of risk factors is updated as appropriate during the year in quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, and includes, but is not limited to, pricing, operational, strategic, regulatory, and financial markets risks that may be impacted by climate change

Illinois Farmers Insurance Company,"  We expect the overall losses from the perils of Wildfire, Flood and Hurricane, which are sensitive to climate change, to increase for society as a whole, and the insurance industry in particular  Wildfire risk is of particular concern to us given our concentration in the western United States  In addition, Farmers faces climate-related regulatory and legal risks

Farmers manages its climate-related catastrophe risk through actuarially sound pricing, judicious use of reinsurance, and statistical modeling of enterprise capital under various stress scenarios  Farmers uses both internal and external catastrophe models to make our best assessment of prospective catastrophe risk for pricing, capital optimization and reinsurance purposes  We adjust the models based on our own experience, research and historical model performance  Our capital modeling work generates outputs on a deterministic and probabilistic basis which we use to manage our enterprise view of risk  The external models for the hurricane peril are fairly mature, and we have reasonable confidence that they provide a good foundation for estimating the hazard risk in the near-term scenarios  Models for wildfire and non-hurricane weather perils are less mature and we therefore adjust the model results based on internal company data and informed judgment  While the modeling data and outputs continue to improve over time, there is still uncertainty around the outputs  Regulatory and legal risks create additional uncertainty, as the various state regulators are not consistent about which models and model adjustments they will allow for use in pricing  Farmers views this uncertainty as a reason to be cautious and conservative in our selection and pricing of risk, and our overall tolerance of catastrophe exposure

United Guaranty Residential Insurance Companies," The majority of policies exposed to catastrophic events are one-year contracts allowing us to quickly adjust our exposure to catastrophic events if climate changes or other events increase the frequency or severity of catastrophes

AIG uses industry recognized models and other tools to evaluate catastrophic events and assess the probability and magnitude of such events  We use catastrophe models based on parameters and assumptions that are rigorously checked for credibility In 2013, we established the Independent Validation Group (IVG) as part of our comprehensive Model Risk Management, which is governed by the Operational Risk Committee and Board of Directors  IVG continues to perform critical reviews of results and documentation of end-to-end processes for model development, implementation, and use  IVG contributes to identifying potential catastrophe model limitations and assessing their possible impacts, thereby enabling prudent underwriting of traditional climate risks such as natural catastrophe covers, catastrophe bonds, and weather risk transfer solutions  AIG periodically monitors the exposure risks of our worldwide operations and adjusts the models accordingly
Climate change may increase both the frequency and severity of natural catastrophes  As such, AIG has performed sensitivity analyses to quantify the impact on potential losses which account for greater variances

Swiss Re LIfe & Health America Inc," The need to reduce greenhouse gases is a core message of Swiss Re's public position statement on climate change and is pursued through an emissions reduction program, publications, public speaking, and other communication actions, as well as organizations of which the company is a member (eg, The Climate Group and ClimateWise) Swiss Re believes a commitment to reducing the company's carbon footprint is key to having a robust and effective climate change program  Having strong credentials in the climate/sustainability area provides additional value to a company like Swiss Re as it can help attract socially responsible investors as well as make the company a more desirable place to work for top university graduates and other prospective employees  

The companies in NAIC Group 181 participate in a dedicated Climate Change strategy sponsored by the ultimate parent of the Group, Swiss Re Ltd (""Swiss Re"") A central pillar of the strategy is to reduce its carbon footprint In 2003 Swiss Re became the first major financial player to commit to going carbon neutral The plan was to do this by 2013 However, through a mix of emission reduction measures and the purchase of high quality carbon off-sets, this target was achieved in late 2007 

As part of Swiss Re's commitment to reducing the company's carbon footprint we have set specific goals for a CO2 emissions intensity reduction of 506%/employee by 2013 against reference year 2003 (strengthened three times from the original 15% to its current level of 506%) and a reduction of energy intensity/employee by 20% by 2013 against reference year 2003 (a new goal set in 2008) A major contributing factor to the reduction of emissions is the company's commitment to purchase renewable energy wherever this is feasible 80% of the power consumed by our US operations comes from renewable energy By 2012 total Swiss Re group emissions have been reduced by 556% At the end of 2012, energy intensity across the Group was 424% lower than in 2003  and down by 66% from 2011 The improvement during 2012 was partly due to the fact that we were able to reap the full benefits of moving into our newly constructed, energy-efficient office building in Fort Wayne, Indiana 

In 2007, to encourage our staff to reduce their personal carbon footprints, Swiss Re introduced an employee subsidy program (COYou2 - Reduce and Gain) Subsidies of up to  CHF 5000/employee are paid for employee investment in low carbon technology To date approximately 5,750 subsidy payments have been made worldwide including over 1,750 in 2012 75 of these payments went to US based employees The top three most popular investments made in the US were in energy efficient appliances, energy efficient replacement windows and hybrid vehicles The company has also introduced an internal ""e-learning"" course for employees The course explains the climate change issue, actions which the company is taking and discusses what actions employees can take themselves 

Swiss Re recognizes that the insurance industry can reduce emissions through, for example, moving claims handling from a paper based to an electronic process In its US operations the company has operated a fully electronic claims process for many years

Understanding the implications of climate change is important to the company and is a key
component of our business and long-term risk management strategy We therefore actively
promote and engage in research on climate related risks and incorporate key findings into
our risk management processes This knowledge informs our business decisions and
supports the development of innovative insurance solutions to mitigate or adapt to climate
change and severe weather impacts To foster greater risk awareness of climate change, we
engage in dialogue with governments, corporations, civil society and other stakeholders, in addition to taking measures to reduce our own carbon footprint For example in 2013 Swiss Re presented to the US Senate Bicameral Taskforce on Climate Change Swiss Re systematically assesses climate related risk (physical, regulatory, reputation, etc)
as part of our risk management and underwriting process Risks such as potential losses
from climate litigation in the US are monitored on a quarterly basis The company
supplements risk assessment with research into climate change and its economic impact

This process is led by three units: Sustainability & Political Risk Management, Catastrophe Perils, and Emerging Risk Management More details on these units can be found in question 3

Swiss Re's investment activities are also subject to the company's Sustainability Risk
Framework (see additional information linked below) which comprises of country
exclusions, company exclusions and policies covering eight sectors including environmental
considerations which are applied consistently across the re/insurance and investment
activities of the Group

The overall responsibility to monitor our commitment to responsible investment lies with the Asset Management Executive Team, chaired by the Group Chief Investment Officer

Expansion of our facilities in recent years have used environmentally-responsible features for energy consumption and recycling of materials, including a business continuity facility opened in 2010 that was awarded a Gold LEED rating Our headquarters building earned ENERGY STAR certification in May 2015 and received a Silver LEED EBOM (LEED for Existing Buildings: Operations & Maintenance) rating in March 2015, only the second 1 million plus square foot building in Ohio to achieve such rating In June 2016, Newsweek ranked Cincinnati Financial 416 in their 2016 Top Green Companies in the US 

During 2016, we have reduced electricity usage 10 percent below our 2010 level We are committed to serving our customers locally, placing field associates (approximately one-third of our total employees) near the agencies and policyholders they serve, reducing their need for planes, trains and longer automobile trips

As previously reported, Markel is in the process of consolidating all of their Markel North America data centers into a primary and backup site both of which are located in North America  In addition, Markel continues to make significant progress in migrating the Markel North American associate base to virtualized desktops  Virtualization is a process whereby applications are run in separate, isolated partitions (separate virtual machines) within a single server Widely used in datacenters, each virtual machine runs its own operating system and application, and can be moved or copied from one server to another for load balancing or to expand processing capability Along with greater utilization of hardware, this ""live migration"" feature is one of the major benefits of using virtual servers

The Company's affiliated non-insurance operations tend to engage in light manufacturing or service businesses and are not significant producers of emissions

The combination of data center consolidation and virtualization of computing environments is also expected to significantly reduce power consumption in support of business activities

Northwestern Long Term Care Ins.

The Company also recognizes that its policyowners have a very real stake in our society and its institutions  Accordingly, as an investor on behalf of its policyowners the Company aims to include a qualitative consideration of social objectives in the investment decision process  Among the most notable of these objectives is promoting public health and sensitivity to the natural environment, including the efficient use of natural resources and a commitment to pollution control  Investments are considered on a case-by-case basis, and those investments that meet these social objectives in conjunction with appropriate return objectives are encouraged  

Additionally, the Company has a formal program devoted to socially responsive investing, a range of investments that enhance social or environmental goals such as financing alternative energy sources  Socially responsive investments offer participation in new and growing markets, while further diversifying the Companys portfolio  The Companys three investment divisions - real estate, public investments, and private placements - manage the Companys socially responsive investments, including those in alternative energy investments such as wind and solar infrastructure projects

SWISS RE LIFE & HEALTH AMERICA INC.,"g, The Climate Group and ClimateWise) and other
platforms such as the Geneva Association and Clinton Global Initiative Swiss Re is also a
founding member of the Principles of Sustainable Insurance initiative which was launched
in 2012 Swiss Re believes a commitment to reducing the company's carbon footprint is
key to having a robust and effective climate change program Having strong credentials in
the climate/sustainability area provides additional value to a company like Swiss Re as it
can help attract socially responsible investors as well as make the company a more
desirable place to work for top university graduates and other prospective employees

The companies in NAIC Group 181 participate in a dedicated Climate Change strategy
sponsored by the ultimate parent of the Group, Swiss Re Ltd (""Swiss Re"") A central pillar of the strategy is to reduce its carbon footprint In 2003 Swiss Re became the first major financial player to commit to going carbon neutral The plan was to do this by 2013 However, through a mix of emission reduction measures and the purchase of high quality carbon off-sets, this target was achieved in late 2007

As part of Swiss Re's commitment to reducing the company's carbon footprint we set
specific goals for a CO2 emissions intensity reduction of 506%/employee by 2013 against
reference year 2003 (strengthened three times from the original 15% to its current level of 506%) The reduction target was exceeded in 2013 as the company recorded a total
reduction of emissions per employee of 565% since 2003 After the successful completion of the company's 10 year carbon reduction plan in 2013 new targets are being developed for the period 2013 - 2020 Swiss Re also set a target reduction of energy intensity/employee by 20% by 2013 against reference year 2003 (a new goal set in
2008) A major contributing factor to the reduction of emissions is the company's
commitment to purchase renewable energy wherever this is feasible 100% of the power
consumed by our US operations comes from renewable energy At the end of 2013,
energy intensity across the Group was 465% lower than in 2003  and down by 80%
from 2012 The improvement during 2013 was partly due to lower power usage from our
newly constructed, energy-efficient office building in Fort Wayne, Indiana Furthermore, at our Americas head office in Armonk, New York a program was started to replace the entire lighting system with energy efficient LED lights

In 2007, to encourage our staff to reduce their personal carbon footprints, Swiss Re
introduced an employee subsidy program (COYou2 - Reduce and Gain) Subsidies of up to
CHF 5 000/employee are paid for employee investment in low carbon technology To date
approximately 9 000 subsidy payments have been made worldwide including
approximately 2500 in 2013 Over 250 of these payments went to US based employees
The top three most popular investments made in the US were in energy efficient
appliances, doors and windows and hybrid vehicles Due to the success of the program, a
new program cycle was introduced for 2014 - 2020 The company has also introduced an
internal ""e-learning"" course for employees The course explains the climate change issue,
actions which the company is taking and discusses what actions employees can take
themselves

Swiss Re recognizes that the insurance industry can reduce emissions through, for
example, moving claims handling from a paper based to an electronic process In its US
operations the company has operated a fully electronic claims process for many years

Lincoln Life Assurance Company of Boston,"
A comprehensive greenhouse gas inventory, inclusive of some aspects of Scope 3 emissions, has been compiled annually since 2012 by Lincoln Financial Groups Office of Corporate Responsibility and the various administrative services teams responsible for operating and managing Lincolns facilities 
The Office of Corporate Responsibility has a well-established process for collecting and reporting data and information related to the companys environmental impacts, including climate change and GHG emissions Activities and related goals have included and continue to be focused on improvements to facilities to improve energy management and reduce GHG emissions, including occupancy optimization strategies, energy efficiency improvements to equipment, and conservation efforts For example, if the expected ROI for a newly proposed energy reduction project is within 12-18 months, the project will be funded from the current year's energy budget If the ROI period exceeds 18 months, projects are reviewed as part of the annual company-wide strategic planning process All decisions regarding the purchase of equipment, changes to building structures and or systems or processes are evaluated based on the financial cost and benefit to the organization For every project, various methods of accomplishing the goal will be evaluated  Energy efficiency is among the factors considered in the decision-making process
Upon undergoing a renovation in our facilities, Lincoln explores opportunities to integrate energy efficient technologies and compares this with the cost of standard technology For example, Lincoln has used energy efficient technologies, such as chillers and lighting equipment, in several of its locations, including Greensboro, Omaha and Fort Wayne Many of these are capital expenditure projects for which capital is allocated based on analysis of both first cost and cost savings over time, as well as reductions in Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions 
Our original goal for the Greensboro campus was to reduce electricity consumption by 10% by
2020 compared to a 2014 baseline We surpassed that goal in 2018  achieving more than a 17%
reduction  and set a new goal to achieve a total reduction of 35% by 2022 In 2020, we continued to
make progress on this goal and reduced electricity consumption by 34% during our year of working
from home This goal will be superseded by our new 2020 targets that are aligned with the Paris
Agreement (see below)

In our Omaha location, we sought to reduce consumption by 8% by 2020 based on a 2014 baseline
We surpassed this goal in 2019 with a total reduction of nearly 11% In 2020, we continued this trend
of lowering our electricity usage, reaching a total reduction of 32% since 2014

We had previously committed to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions intensity per employee from
purchased electricity (Scope 2) by 20% by 2020 against a 2014 baseline We exceeded this target
earlier than expected, reducing our overall intensity per employee by 2742% in 2019 For 2020, we
continued to decrease our intensity per employee by 45%

Setting new greenhouse gas reduction goals

Lincoln remains committed to reducing our environmental impact in line with evolving best practices
and scientific frameworks

Having successfully achieved the initial targets set in 2014, Lincoln Financial set a new GHG
reduction target in 2020: to reduce Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 25% from a 2019 baseline by the
year 2025

This aligns with the science-based targets methodology for reducing direct emissions Our targets
are consistent with the international Paris Agreements goal to limit global temperatures from rising
more than 15 degrees Celsius compared to pre-industrial levels

The General Automobile Insurance,"

The American Family group of companies has an Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) function that provides risk reporting to the board of directors (BOD) at least 4 times a year  In 2014 and annually since, the BOD approves the enterprise risk policy that explicitly describes the risk appetite and tolerance levels set by senior leadership of the enterprise The policy provides overarching guidance to ensure risk exposures will remain within acceptable boundaries  The overarching guidance provided by the risk policy considers natural catastrophe risk  Tolerances that align with the enterprise appetite have been established for this risk

In its role to evaluate risk to the enterprise, the BOD conducts sessions on risk topics, including on climate risk

To ensure the BOD and executive management receive information about emerging risks, the enterprise has a process in place to identify and assess all risks faced, including financial, operational, technology, regulatory/legal and strategic risks  New and evolving risk identification is conducted in conjunction with strategic planning  Risks identified can include those due to changes in processes, new strategies, or external factors such as the changes to the industry and the way we conduct business  One of the risks is the impact of severe weather events  While this risk is one that is continuously monitored in the organization, the ERM process considers changes to experience, computer models, and trends identified by experts through ERMs networking and involvement in professional organizations  Exposures are evaluated in relation to capital quarterly to ensure the risk is within tolerance, and therefore, within the stated enterprise risk policy appetite and tolerance

American Familys investment managers take the issue of climate risk into consideration in the same manner as any other potential drivers of risk and return in the investment portfolio  Investments are managed to ensure the organization can respond in the event of a natural catastrophe

However, we do consider there to be three types of risk related to climate change for the company  First, there is the physical risk that an increase in the threat of extreme weather caused by climate change enhances the concern of ensuring business operations continue and associates are kept safe at all times  

Secondly, climate change could result in energy or resource scarcity, which in turn would create higher energy/water costs  Although energy/water costs make up only a minor part of our overall cost of operations, the threat of increasing energy/water expenses is a concern for all businesses  

Lastly, climate change may have an impact on the environmental health of communities and ultimately the impact this may have on the personal health of the members we serve  Climate change may lead to sicker populations, an increase in the prevalence and spread of infectious diseases and increased cases of respiratory conditions  Additionally, research has already shown that some diseases (eg asthma, diabetes) have ties to the environment  The extent the health of our members and the cost trend of providing quality health care are impacted by changing environmental conditions could impact our company

The Hanover American Insurance Company,"  For these reasons, we consider the impact of climate change and environmental issues as important factors to include in the fundamental research process we employ to manage investment assets As described in question two, we incorporate environmental factors in our decision making for asset allocation and screening for security selection for publicly listed common stocks and fixed income securities of corporate and municipal issuers  Our investment professionals employ both qualitative and quantitative screens of environmental factors, as appropriate, to identify industry and company-specific risks and opportunities  The findings from this process are then incorporated with the other relevant information we consider as part of our broader investment decision making

This awareness leads us to favor investments in companies with a demonstrated commitment toward a reduced carbon footprint and increased reliance on cleaner and or renewable energy sources  In addition, since climate change can affect weather patterns, our investment decision making recognizes that certain regions and parts of the country are more vulnerable to rising ocean levels, coastal flooding and storms, drought, wild fire and other natural disasters

As described in the published ESG investment policy:
	The Hanover supports, in recognition of climate change, investment in electric utilities with: (i) low or declining coal exposure in their generation mix, (ii) increasing exposure to renewable sources of energy production, or (iii) a demonstrated commitment and progress toward achieving a reduced carbon footprint Accordingly, we will not make new investments in the securities of companies that will rely on coal for more than 25% of their fuel to generate electricity after 2025 Existing investments that exceed this threshold will be phased out by 2025 

	The Hanover will exercise caution toward investment in companies or entities that are involved in: (i) mining or processing thermal coal, (ii) development of any new coal mine or coal power infrastructure, and (iii) producing, processing, or shipping crude oil produced from tar sands Accordingly, we will not make new investments in the securities of companies in the coal and tar sands industries that will generate more than 25% of their revenue from mining or processing thermal coal after 2025, (ii) are in the process of developing, or have plans to develop, any new coal mine, new coal plant or new coal infrastructure, and (iii) will have more than 25% of their oil reserves in tar sands and/or will generate more than 25% of their revenue from the shipment of tar sands oil after 2025 Existing investments that exceed these thresholds will be phased out by 2025

Natinwide Affinity Insurance Company of America,"  A robust Enterprise Risk Management program identifies potential risks and develops controls to systematically assess the impact of these risks to its business  
As part of the detailed risk assessment, Nationwides Enterprise Risk Management team works in collaboration with the business leaders across the multiple businesses to understand the risk that climate change poses over the strategic horizon  This process involves identifying exposure for incremental risk and reward as well as assessing the companys capabilities against industry practices  Risks associated with climate change as identified through Nationwides risk assessment process are discussed in the response to question four above
In order to measure the risks from certain natural perils potentially associated with climate change, Nationwide licenses the software and support of external catastrophe modeling vendors  These vendors constantly review and update their models to incorporate the most recent science available 
These models allow Nationwide to measure their catastrophe exposure and develop a perspective on the potential size and likelihood of various catastrophes  These models also allow the Nationwide companies to assess how various strategies will impact this risk including changes to deductibles, changes to market shares and geographic diversification
Specific to the hurricane peril, the major catastrophe modeling vendors have developed alternative event scenario catalogs associated with increased sea surface temperatures which some scientists might attribute to global warming  Elevated sea surface temperatures are important because hurricanes are fueled by the warmth of the ocean  These alternative event catalogs, therefore, represent a climate-conditioned view of risk  This alternate view is used to assess the sensitivity of insured risk to elevated sea surface temperatures  
Beyond the direct output from the models, measurement and sensitivity analysis can be informed by maintaining external partnerships in academia, trade associations, experts from the modeling vendors, and reinsurers and brokers  Nationwide has developed these types of external relationships and regularly avails itself of information from these sources as an integral part of the risk management program
Additional techniques utilized by Nationwide to manage catastrophe risks are discussed in the response to question six above

KAISER FOUND HLTH PLAN OF WA OPTIONS," The ERM program is governed by executive management and the Board of Directors The program has a strategic and multi-year (three-year) lens It deals with risks and opportunities that can affect value creation and preservation over time, and provides a holistic view of risks, including external, operational, and strategic Climate change is included as a key aspect of the ""trends impacting health"" risk
With regard to managing health risks correlated with climate change, KP is uniquely positioned to 1) have early indications regarding weather/climate-related conditions through its research programs, and 2) provide timely and responsive care to members through its integrated care delivery system In terms of facility risks, KP has a robust business continuity program that ensures continued operations in the event of natural or manmade disasters
KPs executive leadership has adopted an organizational guideline related to climate change, excerpted below:
If greenhouse gas emissions continue to increase, climate change will cause health effects that will directly impact KPs ability to fulfill our promise of quality affordable care Global climate instability will increase the demand for health care The costs of energy and water are likely to increase while supplies are diminished Threats to biodiversity could also threaten the availability of potential cures for diseases KP adopts the following principles:
1	Understand climate change
2	Assess and avoid climate-related impacts
3	Commit to continuous improvement
4	Support industry standards
5	Inform public policies
As noted in KPs response to question 1, KP has a goal to become carbon neutral in 2020, and one way that KP reduces its avoidable emissions is through large-scale investments in clean and renewable energy sources An added benefit of these investments is that, by providing KP with a long-term fixed price for electricity, they provide KP with an important hedge against potentially significant swings in energy prices resulting from climate impacts and/or climate policies

ACE American Ins Co," Risk assessment flows sequentially from risk identification and is performed by executive-level risk owners and business management both, routinely, as part of day-to-day activities through ad-hoc analyses and, formally, with an annual assessment of the inherent nature of the risk, key controls and any emerging issues 

The actual level and type of risk assessment employed in each situation depends on many factors: the nature of the risk, its materiality to Chubb, the quality of the data, the underlying facts and science and, finally, potential actions post-assessment Quantification typically involves an assessment of the severity and likelihood of occurrence, analysis of Chubbs exposures (eg underwriting limits deployed, counter-party exposure) relative to risk measures (eg earnings, capital, liquidity, industry market share) and other considerations, such as collateral Specific examples of risk assessment measures utilized are accumulation and scenario These analyses may be supported by other activities including analytics, claims, actuarial, legal, investments and underwriting

Chubb is a leading proponent and user of catastrophe models to quantify natural catastrophe risk for product pricing, risk management, capital allocation and to simulate and estimate hurricane losses Chubb uses models to aggregate and closely monitor natural catastrophe exposures across its global portfolio and to ensure that its capital base is sufficiently strong to meet the expectations of regulators, rating agencies and policyholders and to provide shareholders with an appropriate risk-adjusted return This information is valuable in identifying possible market opportunities, including where and how we might be able to offer coverage to consumers and businesses in areas exposed to natural perils Chubbs risk management modeling and underwriting practices are adapted to the developing risk exposures attributed to climate change Since the earths climate appears to be changing in ways inconsistent with the historical record upon which catastrophe models draw data, Chubb has adopted a framework to think about how changes in short- and long-term frequency should be factored into its risk management systems Standard & Poors rated Chubbs ERM process Strong in its June 2018 ERM Rating Report, placing Chubb among the top 20% of North America and Bermuda insurers Chubb invests to continually upgrade and refine its risk management tools for catastrophes such as floods and hurricanes Chubb accounts for the potential impact of catastrophe and climate risks on the companys own facilities and operations Direct risk to Chubbs business operations exists if such weather events occur where Chubb has offices Severe weather events have tested Chubbs Business Continuity Program and operations have functioned effectively Chubbs risk analysis ranges from the known (based on definitive historical loss experience) to the hypothetical (based on a probable maximum loss (PML) calculation)

Through the use of catastrophe models, Chubb manages severe weather risk to indirect client exposures throughout the world Special emphasis is given to areas where Chubb has significant exposures and the inherent risk from extreme weather events  such as tropical cyclone and other windstorm  is deemed to be high, such as the coastal United States, Southeast Asia and UK/Europe To aid in prioritizing management focus on extreme weather events, each peril region is classified as either Tier 1, 2 or 3 according to the exposures and risk combination present Tier 1 regions are the highest priority areas for the company as they present the greatest risk profile and are the most carefully managed Tier 2 and 3 regions are also closely managed at the regional and business unit level In addition to modeled peril regions, we focus on non-modeled perils, such as flood, which present a risk in many of the developing areas of the Chubb insurance portfolio We continue to invest in developing and refining tools to identify and track our exposures related to flood, given an increasing incidence in flood losses in our property insurance portfolio over the last decade

Since the insurance products that we provide clients around the world may provide coverage for all of the risks noted, there are potential financial implications for Chubb The extent of potential negative implications depends on whether the loss is covered by the policy's terms and conditions and whether the underlying assumptions modeled in determining the pricing of the policy adequately reflect the potential risk If the model used to price coverage proves faulty or doesnt anticipate the potential magnitude of these risks in the future, then losses paid could exceed premiums collected, causing the company to draw a higher amount from its loss reserve pool that is set aside to pay future claims Conversely, if actual loss experience is lower than anticipated, positive adjustments could be made to reserve levels, producing a financial gain for the company If losses are not covered by Chubbs policies, or if the losses are within the assumptions used to price the coverage, then there would be no adverse financial implications for Chubb",2

Furthermore from an investment portfolio standpoint we believe any risks or opportunities associated with climate change, such as carbon and water restrictions, are generally priced into the cost of the investment through the market; any potential arbitrage opportunities would have imbedded investment risk which we believe to be inappropriate for us to take given our overall risk tolerance profile

 Information Technology (IT): There are several efforts within Cambias IT infrastructure where technology and date center infrastructure changes have resulted in efficiencies directed at power, cooling, and space:
o Major cooling upgrade to Salt Lake City data center
o Switch to more efficient servers
o Server virtualization
o Mainframe consolidation
o Increased data storage efficiencies
o Replace firewall infrastructure with a more energy-efficient system
o Replaced load balancer infrastructure with a more energy-efficient system
o Upgraded our call center telephone system
o Recycle eWaste though a BAN-certified eCyclerShift to print on demand and double-sided paper
 Real Estate and Facilities:
o Replaced aging HVAC system (boilers and chillers) with more energy efficient system
o Established standardized HVAC temperature set points, to maximize unit efficiencies, which reduced energy consumption
o Implemented daylight harvesting in Burlington, and implementing in locations when remodels occur
o Changed lighting in Salem garage from sodium vapor to fluorescent
o Received Energy Star certification in 2 locations (Burlington and Tacoma), tracking energy use in all locations through Energy Star
o Contracting with a janitorial vendor that uses proprietary green cleaners and microfiber towels
o Renovating and maintaining our office space through use of low VOC paints and carpets, purchasing products with recycled content, reusing materials and furniture where possible, recycling materials such as carpet
o Conducting waste audits to assess the waste stream and identify opportunities to reduce waste and increase recycling
 Human Resources
o Reducing our actual footprint through telework and mobile work arrangements An estimated 27% of Cambia employees now work remotely This initiative has reduced/eliminated commutes for these employees with a commensurate reduction in emissions (We have not measured the reduced emissions or other environmental benefits of this shift to remote and mobile work) While we expect this effort to have decreased emissions, we recognized that there is some displacement of emissions to employees who are now lighting, heating, and cooling their homes during the day when they are working from home
o Cambia has a strong commute reimbursement program that subsidizes public transit passes and carpooling
o Cambia also has a strong bike commuter program that encourages employees to bike to work The bike commuter program also provides support to beginning bike commuters through a bike buddy program and various bike-commuting workshops Cambia participates in May Bike to Work Month and the Bike Commute Challenge in September We estimate that 80 employees bike commute during the summer and 40 commute regularly by bike in the winter",0
Truck Insurance Exchange," Changes to the frequency and severity of natural catastrophes pose significant risk to our business We expect the overall losses from the perils of Wildfire, Flood and Hurricane, which are sensitive to climate change, to increase for society as a whole, and the insurance industry in particular Wildfire risk is of particular concern to us given our concentration in the western United States In addition, Farmers faces climate-related regulatory and legal risks

Farmers manages its climate-related catastrophe risk through actuarially sound pricing, prudent risk eligibility guidelines, judicious use of reinsurance, and statistical modeling of enterprise capital under various stress scenarios Farmers uses both internal and external catastrophe models to make our best assessment of prospective catastrophe risk for pricing, risk selection, capital optimization and reinsurance purposes We adjust the models based on our own experience, research and historical model performance Our capital modeling and solvency assessment work generates outputs on a deterministic and probabilistic basis which we use to manage our enterprise view of risk The external models for the hurricane peril are fairly mature, and we have reasonable confidence that they provide a good foundation for estimating the hazard risk in the near-term scenarios Models for wildfire and non-hurricane weather perils are less mature and we therefore adjust the model results based on internal company data and informed judgment In 2019, we upgraded to a newly released version of an industry-leading Wildfire Model (from Applied Insurance Research), which increased our assumptions about both the frequency of Wildfire occurring, and the potential severity of larger fires While the modeling data and outputs continue to improve over time, there is still uncertainty around the outputs Regulatory and legal risks create additional uncertainty, as the various state regulators are not consistent about which models and model adjustments they will allow for use in pricing Farmers views this uncertainty as a reason to be cautious and conservative in our selection and pricing of risk, and our overall tolerance of catastrophe exposure

American Family Home," Loss drivers are mainly socioeconomic factors (eg expand-ing urban areas, higher values, settlement in exposed areas) However climate change (CC) might al-so be a driver of this trend CC translates into changes in the frequency and intensity of weather-related natural hazards Changing climate conditions leading to higher loss levels are not automatical-ly balanced in that way, giving rise to solvency issues if going undetected for many years This is true for both climate variability (eg the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation influencing hurricane activity lev-els) and long-term anthropogenic CC Therefore, from a risk management perspective it is crucial to understand the components of change in risk accounted for by external drivers such as climate Ac-cording to data gathered by Munich Res NatCatSERVICE (loss database for natural catastrophes), there is an increase in weather-related natural catastrophes: the average for the last ten years (20032012) is significantly higher than the average for the last 30 years (19832012), while geophysical events remained largely unchanged on average In 2012, natural catastrophes caused US $160bn in overall losses and US $65bn in insured losses worldwide The losses were above the ten year aver-age of US$ 50bn for insured losses and slightly below the average of US $165bn for overall losses USA: Around two-thirds of the overall losses and nearly 90% of insured losses in 2012 can be at-tributed to the USA The year's largest insured loss was caused by Hurricane Sandy (US $30bn) fol-lowed by the Midwest drought (US $1517bn) For the period 19802012, some 3,400 loss events in USA are registered, for which 84% of insured losses (US$590bn) can be attributed to various kinds of storm (high insurance density), 9% to climatologically events (extreme temperature, droughts, forest fire), 2% to floods and just 5% to geophysical events Changing climatic conditions are having a con-siderable influence on the variability in severe thunderstorm overall losses in the USA This correlation is documented by a scientific peer-reviewed study Rising variability in thunderstorm-related US losses as a reflection of changes in large-scale thunderstorm forcing This study, conducted in coop-eration with the German Aerospace Center, covers the period from 1970 to 2009 After adjustment of the losses to take account of socio-economic changes, increases in losses still remain, which cannot be explained by changes in exposed values In parallel, there has been an increase in the meteorolog-ical potential for severe thunderstorms and its variability In this study it has been possible for the first time to prove scientifically that climatic changes are already having an impact on US thunderstorm losses
(ii) Methods to handle business-related risks: There is a need to understand all aspects of risks and the correlated dynamics Detailed exposure and loss data, current hazard maps and vulnerability in-formation are crucial to estimate loss potential from natural perils Our objective is to ensure efficient premium calculation and identify unknown accumulations risks In order to successfully perform our role as a global risk carrier, we need to take account of changes in risk in our underwriting Our dedi-cated team of geo risks researchers (including storm experts) ensures that we constantly enhance our knowledge of the direct consequences of natural climate variability and of anthropogenically induced CC and uses it to deliver tailored insurance solutions as well as to integrate the findings into our pric-ing models As regards our business-related risks, in our client relationships the short-term effects of climatic variability are primarily taken into account in property business (annual renewal as well as ad-aptation of pricing), where weather-related factors play an important role Considerable uncertainty is involved in predicting changes in occurrence frequencies and intensities, assessing the regional as-pects of extreme atmospheric events and predicting what emerging-risk developments are to be ex-pected Research: We are accumulating expertise from various scientific partnerships and from our own databases, eg since 2008, Munich Re has been formally cooperating with the London School of Economics (LSE) and is a founding corporate partner of the Centre of CC Economic and Policy, which has the objective of researching into the medium- and long-term effects of CC for the insurance industry and the economy (ie the business-strategy perspective of CC) Furthermore an indirect approach and approved method for the detection of changing loss patterns to address the issue of long-term change is the method of normalization This method can be used for hazards which cannot be spatial-ly resolved with todays climate models and such as analyzed in the peer-reviewed study (above men-tioned) conducted by Munich Re experts and the German Aerospace Center and published in 2013 by the American Meteorological Society
The Munich Re NatCatSERVICE provides the basis for a wide range of information, tools and services related to risk management and research, but are also used by scientific and institutional facilities and the media The data is obtained from more than 200 information sources such as news agencies, weather/geological services, insurance-related associations, and scientific institutions Globally, the database currently comprises more than 30,000 data records of individual loss events caused by all types of natural perils, providing information on the effects they have on the insurance sector, on na-tional economies, and on society To share knowledge of scientific data and findings with its clients Munich Re developed the NATHAN Risk Suite, a service for identifying and assessing complex natu-ral hazard risks containing scientific and insurance-related information including individual-risk or port-folio analysis For example, NATHAN enables new accumulation risks arising from a rapid increase in new technologies (eg renewable energies) to be analyzed faster and more accurately In 2012, Mu-nich Re published a new 274-page book entitled: Severe weather in North America: Perils  Risks  Insurance written by MR experts The publication offers information mainly for North American clients on atmospheric-related risks (hurricanes, tornados, winter storms, floods, forest fires, droughts), dis-cusses risk exposure and CC, and addresses the special aspects involved in underwriting such risks in the US and Canada Methods to handle company-related risks: Changes in meteorological climate parameters can have a direct impact on Munich Re, in particular on company premises To ensure the safety of our staff and to minimize the impact of business interruption events, business-driven risk management and a business continuity plan are in place The business continuity management guide-lines have been implemented Group-wide and incorporate issues such as emergencies, crises and recovery management Local business continuity plans are tailored to the exposure of individual loca-tions and include events such as floods and storms In 2011, directly after the earthquake in Japan our subsidiary in Tokyo was immediately relocated, thus ensuring that it could continue to operate

Progressive Express Insurance Company,"

For example, as a company that owns or leases real property, our company has some exposure to physical risks from climate change We maintain insurance on our real property and other physical assets, including coverage for losses due to business interruptions caused by covered property damage 

To help maintain functionality and reduce the risk of significant interruptions of our operations, we have business continuity plans for all business critical areas as well as robust back-up systems or facilities for key principal systems and services 

In addition, we have established emergency management teams, which are responsible for responding to business disruptions and other risk events The teams ability to respond successfully may be limited depending on the nature of the event, the completeness and effectiveness of our plans to maintain business continuity upon the occurrence of such an event, and other factors beyond our control

Our risk management team employs sophisticated weather modeling techniques to quantify the potential financial consequences of catastrophic weather events in order to evaluate the amount of capital we would need to continue to run our business if such events occur

Climate change could affect the frequency and severity of extreme weather-related events such as hurricanes, which can have a material effect on our available capital Also, if driving behaviors change such that consumers drive less or reduce commuting distances or if there is a shift toward greater usage of mass transit to slow global warming, demand for our product offering could be affected

Finally, extreme global weather volatility could increase risk financing costs Risk financing is the process by which a company secures the appropriate funds to cover unexpected financial losses arising from a risk that the company has deliberately retained Both capacity in the reinsurance market and availability of capital from the catastrophe bond market could, theoretically, become constrained after the occurrence of extreme weather events

American Familys latest construction project, the Spark complex on Madisons east side, received the IBHS Fortified GOLD Commercial High Wind and Hail certification in April of 2019 It was the first commercial building in the country to receive this designation The structure was designed and built not only to be sustainable, but it was also built to some of the most stringent standards of resiliency known The structure itself was designed to be strong, safe for occupants and if necessary, has its own back-up power and HVAC systems so that it can remain operational even if the infrastructure fails 

American Family also supports transportation alternatives such as reducing the impact of business travel and employee commuting through increased use of webcasts and videoconferencing Since 2006, video conferencing systems and other telepresence technology have provided virtual communications alternatives to reduce travel In 2013, trailer skirts were installed on the over the road trailer, resulting in an annual 3 percent reduction in fuel use and an annual reduction of  2,400 metric tons of CO2 emissions In April 2012, The League of American Bicyclists designated American Family Insurances Madison, WI, headquarters as a Bronze Bicycle Friendly Business (BFB), based on best practices for staff and the greater community

SWISS RE LIFE & HEALTH AMERICA INC.,"

Catastrophe modeling is essential when hazards are either infrequent or historic data may
not be representative of future events Swiss Re deploys computer based risk modeling for
natural catastrophes which are continually refined and developed by a dedicated unit based
in Europe and the United States This team, the Catastrophe Perils unit, includes experts in windstorm, tropical cyclone and flooding The unit designs and maintains the models and
supports the assessment of climate related risks as a part of the process of underwriting
insurance and reinsurance business Models are regularly updated taking into account
recent events If any of these events have been influenced by climate change then the data
will be captured in the model Please see question 3 for further information

Swiss Re's modeling expertise is also used in the context of researching the potential
economic cost of future climate change under various scenarios This approach has been
utilized in Florida and the Gulf Coast Most recently Swiss Re provided the climate risk
assessment for New York City in its report ""A Stronger More Resilient New York"", mentioned
in question 6

The company encourages the management of climate related risks and the progression
towards a lower carbon economy through re/insurance products supporting the
development of renewable energy and investments in clean technologies These products
are used in the renewable energy industry to help stabilize future earnings, reduce financing costs, and increase the attractiveness of investment in clean energy, thereby promoting its deployment One example is the wind industry Swiss Re offers tailor-made structured insurance and derivative solutions to manage revenue risk resulting from uncertain wind conditions enabling better financing terms to reduce capital costs Existing wind farms and new wind projects benefit from these solutions as they reduce revenue volatility A typical wind output hedge is structured to provide certainty in production volume at single or multiple sites Swiss Re can structure a hedge with the payout based on a parametric index to compensate against shrinking operating income due to lack of or excess wind By stabilizing future earnings and cash flows, the result is reduced financing costs, increased opportunities for future investment, and an important contribution enabling the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions Products using the same concept are used by clients in various renewable energy industries including, such as wind farms in Texas, hydroelectric generating facilities in the Pacific Northwest, and many other sites around the world

Re/insurance protection is an essential component for the development of renewable energy projects and therefore the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions Without insurance the risks associated with the construction and operation of clean energy production facilities would make them less attractive to investors or potentially nonviable as
an investment opportunity Swiss Re offers this kind of coverage for solar, wind, geothermal, small-scale hydro-electric and bio-mass production sites

USAA Life Ins Co," USAA uses an extensive suite of catastrophe models purchased from well-known and well-respected vendors The Catastrophe Risk Management unit has dedicated computing resources and trained personnel to run these models internally Catastrophe model results are refreshed and evaluated monthly to track the impact of exposure changes on projected losses (Average Annual Loss, Tail Value-At-Risk, and Probable Maximum Loss) An extensive refresh of model parameters, assumptions and input data is performed annually to shape underwriting and pricing guidelines in catastrophe-prone areas In addition to internally-run vendor models, external  research is  also utilized to validate and inform underwriting, pricing and business decisions related to these risks

¿	Internal Models

USAA uses state-of-the-art modeling software to measure hurricane, wildfire, winterstorm and severe thunderstorm (including tornado) risk The selection of model parameters can produce a wide range of possible exceedance probability curves, so parameter estimation is calibrated with the purpose of any given model run For example,  USAA uses a subset of historical years with higher than average sea surface temperatures that can be used to parameterize the computer model as a proxy for estimating hurricanes under global warming conditions 

¿	External Models, Research and Validation
In addition to the models maintained internally, USAA works closely with its reinsurance brokers to validate model parameters and results  This allows us to improve quantification of the range of risks posed by natural catastrophes, including estimating future impact
USAA monitors scientific research on climate issues, including findings of the IPCC, the US Department of Defense, the National Climate Assessment of the US Global Research Program, the Actuaries Climate Index Research Project, and various actuarial and scientific journals This research shapes assessment of weather-related, regulatory and business operation risks, and informs model validation and parameterization
This assessment and research leads to more uncertainty in model results As a result of model uncertainty, USAA has set conservative capital requirements These conservative capital requirements drive our underwriting, pricing, and reinsurance-purchase decisions Growth in catastrophe-prone areas is managed in light of these risks, and USAA purchases enough reinsurance and holds enough capital to cover potential impacts of changing weather patterns USAA also realizes that it is insufficient to be prepared for only the types of catastrophes experienced in the past 100 years  Consequently, USAA performs annual stress tests to simulate the impact of extremely rare catastrophe losses on business operations, claims settlements, and overall financial strength USAA uses these stress tests to understand its strengths and weaknesses, so that we can adapt to new conditions and continue to provide excellent service and remain financially sound even if an unprecedented event happens

1)	Ecosurance® is the portfolio of green products provided by Lexington Insurance Company, AIGs Boston-based surplus lines insurance unit:
	Upgrade to Green® Residential, first launched in 2007, provides coverage for certain products and materials identified as having ENERGY STAR® or equivalent levels of energy efficiency Repairs and replacements include, but are not limited to, lighting systems, heating/cooling equipment, windows, insulation, appliances, home electronics, indoor plumbing, and flooring materials
	Upgrade to Green Commercial responds to covered partial and total losses for both Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED®) certified and non LEED certified buildings In the event of a total loss, LEED certified insureds are provided coverage to upgrade their building to the next level of LEED certification upon reconstruction Non-LEED certified insureds can use the coverage to rebuild to a LEED silver standard
	LexElite Eco-Homeowner® responds to the unique risks faced by homeowners who generate their own power and feed surplus energy back into the local power grid If a homeowners alternative-energy system has a covered outage, LexElite Eco-Homeowner will protect the homeowner against lost income generated from selling surplus energy back to the grid and will cover the extra expenses incurred to purchase replacement electricity
	In August 2009, Lexington launched Upgrade to Green Builders Risk, which provides coverage that supports green building construction and renovation projects registered with the US-based LEED or the GREEN GLOBES® rating systems Available as an endorsement to Lexingtons Completed Value Builders Risk Policy, it extends coverage to address the risks green buildings face during three key areas of construction: project management and administration, site ecological impacts, and consumption of resources

2)	The Private Client Group (PCG) division of AIG PC provides insurance products and loss prevention expertise to high net worth individuals and families Since 2008, this division has introduced several products to encourage property development of high environmental efficiency, including: 
	For US based clients, PCG offers Green Rebuilding Cost, which allows policyholders to rebuild with materials that are more energy efficient, conserve water and other natural resources, and provide a healthier environment inside the home 
	For UK-based clients, PCG offers a Green Rebuilding Cost Coverage as part of its standard Home & Contents policy for high-net worth individuals This covers the installation of green building products that will use less energy, water and/or natural resources, create less waste and provide a healthier environment for residents

3)	Lexington also offers a suite of three insurance solutions for businesses in the developing climate change and greenhouse gas emissions sector:
	Newest to the suite, as of September 2012, is CarbonCover ODS, designed for project developers who are collecting tangible physical assets for the purpose of creating emission reductions and carbon offset credits CarbonCover ODS responds to direct physical loss or damage of a physical asset that is being collected to create carbon offset credits These assets can include ozone depleting substances (ODS) that are removed from refrigeration systems or methane gas that is extracted from landfills or underground mines Direct physical loss or damage to the asset is measured as the value of the carbon offset credits that would have been issued for the destroyed asset absent the loss, in accordance with a carbon registrys project protocol
	CarbonCoverSM Registry, launched in January 2010, which provides professional liability insurance for registries that track, confirm, and verify carbon offset credits; and
	CarbonCover Design & Confirm, extends Lexingtons architects and engineers professional liability coverage to expressly cover claims arising from greenhouse gas consulting services or emission reduction verification services

4)	In an effort to encourage customers to reduce carbon emissions from vehicle travel and support their efforts toward environmental responsibility, AIG PC introduced the Auto Physical Damage Alternative Fuel Incentive Endorsement in 2010 Available with commercial automobile liability policies, this enhanced coverage allows customers to waive or be reimbursed for their auto physical damage deductible, up to a maximum of $1,000, if a covered gasoline powered vehicle is deemed a total loss and is replaced with a green automobile This endorsement builds on two products launched by The Private Client Group division of AIG PC in 2008: New Vehicle Replacement Coverage and the 5% Hybrid Vehicle Discount Under the former, if a new vehicle is totaled within three years of its purchase, the client can opt to receive the agreed value, replace it with a vehicle of the same year, make and model, or receive a new vehicle of the same make and like model, including hybrids or alternate fuel editions The latter applies a discount to bodily injury liability, property damage liability, medical payments, uninsured motorist, collision and comprehensive coverages for owners of hybrid and alternative fuel vehicles",5

Bankers Insurance Company,"  The company utilizes catastrophe models to determine the extent of, plan for and measure weather related events  Consideration is gen to climate change to the extent that it is considered by the third party models that Bankers uses to review warm sea-surface temperature or near-term views in these models to provide correlation to historical trends

Bankers considers modeled and historic loss trends to determine reinsurance structure and attachment/limit, and incorporates these factors into our risk management strategies  They are also used to determine levels of reinsurance and capital requirements to mete claims needs, pricing adequacy for catastrophic costs and to set guidelines to mitigate catastrophe exposures

Most catastrophe models today are approved by regulators and are generally developed using the latest weather and climate data and science, tested by metrological, engineering, computer science and actuarial experts  The models often create alterations that account for perils where they believe future losses may deviate substantially from historical trends, specifically for Hurricanes  In these cases, Bankers considers the potential impact on the catastrophe loss distributions shown by these models

Furthermore, Bankers also takes into consideration different assumptions of Hurricane frequency and severity to match both the historic and the potential future hazard trends to test the impact of climate change on loss distribution  In addition to assumption sets created by model vendors, Bankers models scenarios of past severe events to determine the impact of prior storms on the current portfolio  Finally, Bankers considers deterministic scenarios to identify the potential impact of a worst-case scenario across its portfolio  The results of these stress tests are evaluated when deciding the best risk management strategy for the company, reinsurance purchases and growth plans and projections

Property insurance is an annual product, therefore, pricing underwriting and reinsurance and risk management strategies must evolve over the course of the year to match the changing market and climate environment As such, Bankers considers our view of risk as informed by the catastrophe models, to represent the most up-to-date view of the current environment for catastrophe events that may impact the portfolio  Consequently, the effects of climate change are accounted for on an ongoing basis, as the potential effect become known",7

	Standards and Governance: continuous improvement of the Group-wide environmental management system (based on ISO 14001) 
	Environmental Reporting (measuring impact): achieving further improvements in the quality of data reported, and ensuring alignment to evolving external reporting standards and best practice
	Strategy and Projects (mitigating impact): develop new opportunities to achieve efficiency gains across operational and business processes
	Communications, Change and Relationship Management: continue to expand environmental networks across the business and broaden the use of business social tools for more effective information sharing and awareness building to achieve impact


In 2008, Zurich set its first global environmental target to reduce carbon emissions per employee by 10 percent by 2013 as compared to a 2007 baseline Zurich exceeded the original carbon reduction target in 2012 Following, Zurich set new environmental targets including a 50 percent reduction in carbon per employee and 40 percent reduction in energy per employee, by 2020 compared to a 2007 baseline In 2016, Zurich exceeded these targets achieving a 53 percent reduction in carbon per employee and 43 percent reduction in energy per employee In 2017 Zurich committed to further long-term environmental targets to be achieved by 2025 against a 2015 baseline  Those targets include Zurich achieving and maintaining a 20% reduction in total carbon emissions per employee, broken down by facilities and business travel emissions, as well as a 20% reduction in energy per employee 

See June 29, 2017 news release: https://wwwzurichcom/en/media/news-releases/2017/2017-0629-01

Additionally, Zurich has been carbon neutral since 2014, investing in the Rimba Raya Biodiversity Reserve, a REDD+ verified project

Zurich has achieved these substantial improvements in environmental performance through the following key programs:
	Purchasing renewable electricity wherever economically and operationally feasible
	Sustainable buildings  Addressing the full building life-cycle, Zurich considers sustainability starting at the selection of our buildings, through construction and office fit-out projects, and during day-to-day operations
	Efficient travel practices  only traveling when necessary and using video and teleconference wherever possible instead Zurich encourages the transition to a more sustainable car fleet

In 2014, Zurich started sourcing 100 percent renewable electricity at its North America headquarters in Schaumburg, IL They continued with this commitment at the newly constructed LEED Platinum headquarters which opened in the fall of 2016 As of 2016, Zurich North America sourced 63 percent renewable electricity out of its total electricity demand  Globally, 45 percent of Zurichs electricity comes from renewable sources

In addition to purchasing renewable electricity, the new LEED Platinum headquarters boasts a number of best practice examples in sustainable building including: a curtain wall system designed to maximize natural light; a system to provide high-quality indoor air; access to public transportation and accommodations for electric and low-emitting vehicles; incorporation of multiple green roofs, totaling more than one acre; landscape including 637 trees and more than 13 acres of native savannah plantings; walking paths and water features; rainwater harvest and re-use; recycling and reduction of waste during construction process and efforts to utilize locally-sourced building materials

In addition, Zurich has also implemented programs to remind employees to power down equipment when it is not in use  Many computer monitors and desktop computers are automatically set to go into a sleep or hibernation mode after a short period of inactivity

Zurich continues to work on reducing its impact from paper and printing Copier/printer machines in many of our locations are set for duplex (two-sided) printing and the print/copy default has been set to black and white vs color  Zurich has implemented a Managed Document Service (MDS) optimization program, reducing the total number of multi-functional devices (MFDs) ), and replacing the remaining fleet with more energy efficient equipment This program was put into place not only to reduce energy consumption and the impact on the environment, but to also deliver significant operational cost savings We have completed the third and final year of this program, reducing the number of MDFs within our North America office buildings from 438 to 348 machines (20% reduction) Find more information about Zurichs Environmental Performance:

Farmers Insurance Company of Arizona,"  As a long-term investor focused on managing assets to liabilities, we believe that investors taking both financial and non-financial considerations into account when making investment decisions will be the most successful in the long term  Issues such as corporate governance, climate change, use of natural resources, health and safety, labor relations, and human rights can be important drivers of investment risk and reward

We believe that a pro-active integration of relevant Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) factors into the investment process alongside traditional financial metrics and state-of-the-art risk management practices could support our investment result  However, integration of such factors requires diligence, expertise and focus  We do not believe that simply dedicating specific investment portfolios to the latest climate branded product of the asset management industry creates sustainable value for our stakeholders and the environment

Our investments are primarily managed by third-party asset managers, and it is at this level that individual security selection decisions are made  These asset managers operate within agreed portfolio guidelines set by Farmers and take all aspects into account, both financial and non-financial, when managing Farmers individual portfolios to ensure maximum value creation

As our core competency is selecting the right asset managers and evaluating them based on their superior investment processes, we have taken the following actions:

1)  For the procurement of new asset managers, we include questions related to the inclusion of ESG factors in the investment process into our request for proposal (RFP)
2)  We have implemented the capability to monitor ESG ratings provided by MSCI in our risk systems  This allows us to enter into a proactive dialogue with our asset managers about risk exposures to environmental factors",4

We utilize a number of strategies to mitigate our risk exposure, such as: carefully evaluating terms and conditions of our policies; incorporating updated information on loss trends in our pricing; managing our underwriting appetite; aggregating risk; and purchasing reinsurance  

We use a risk concentration management tool to monitor/control accumulations of potential losses in geographic areas exposed to weather-related risks and changing weather patterns 

There are other potential impacts beyond underwriting risk:
	Operations  Severe storms can cause flooding and/or building damage which may necessitate office closures We anticipate and mitigate the risk through updated business continuity plans and appropriate technology to enable remote working
	Investments - Water shortages and areas prone to catastrophe related weather events may impact the investment attractiveness of certain geographies or sectors
	Regulatory  Regulatory changes in response to climate change could impact customer demand for our products and/or their ability to implement our loss mitigation recommendations",3
Humana Insurance Company,"  Humana is committed to integrating green building principles into our existing and new portfolio of facilities with a focus on energy and water efficiency Humana advanced this objective through the integration of climate and sustainability factors such as energy efficiency projects at our facilities, access to transportation, Energy Star or LEED guidelines, employee engagement (ie, behavioral change) and other parameters, into the decision criteria used to improve our facility portfolio and select future Humana locations Opportunities for improving the portfolio and achieving energy and GHG reduction goals are identified by the Enterprise Associate and Business Solutions team in collaboration with our external consulting partners  Initiatives may be evaluated and presented to the senior management for support and funding including capital investment, employee involvement (ie, resource support) or other requirements  

Our short-term strategy is informed by our environmental goals, influencing our team to focus on energy efficient operations within our owned and leased facilities, spurring direct investment in both financial and personnel resources These investments have enabled Humana to implement initiatives to achieve our targets such as an ongoing portfolio-wide LED lighting retrofit, which will result in over $1,162,295 in annual energy savings, as well as continued alignment with our previously developed comprehensive set of design standards for office and clinical operations to ensure consistency, energy efficiency, and sustainable practices across new builds and renovations In 2020, we invested more than $300 thousand in building efficiency improvements, optimized our building occupancy rate, and implemented new energy-efficient processes and recycling standards Additional focus on infrastructure projects such as consistent BMS systems in our owned sites will create energy efficiencies We are also exploring renewable energy options to determine opportunity and feasibility toward setting a science-based target Finally, ongoing workspace optimization efforts increase workspace density while also decreasing building vacancies, thereby reducing our physical footprint and alleviating commute burden to reduce energy usage and emissions

On the whole, energy use reduction and greenhouse gas emissions reduction efforts not only drive progress toward our sustainability goals, but also illustrate to our employees and customers our commitment to reduce GHG emissions and operate as efficiently as possible Employee engagement efforts include a continuing focus on increasing work from home with the understanding that this strategy will have a significant impact on Scope 3 emissions, while providing our workforce greater flexibility and reducing operational demands of our facilities

Our long-term strategy is impacted by potential consequences of climate change such as regulation, natural resource scarcity, facility operational costs and human health impacts Our Enterprise Associate and Business Solutions leaders review short- and long-term trends and impacts associated with sustainability and refine our business strategy accordingly For example, Humana's portfolio includes both owned and leased assets where many facility investments are on a long-term basis (up to 10 years) Our sustainable real estate approach ensures these investments take into consideration the long-term impacts of building characteristics on climate change and overall environmental impact, employee wellness, and operational costs

	Utilize lower wattage high efficiency fluorescent lighting in all areas
	All PCs and network copiers/printers are set to auto-sleep mode
	As CRT monitors fail, they are replaced with Energy Star rated LCD monitors
	Employee awareness  encourage all employees to conserve energy both at work and at home
	Light fixtures in the building are on switches that are programmed to turn off if there is inactivity in the area
	Trees and landscaping around the perimeter of the buildings are designed to shade the building to reduce cooling loads
	Torchmark has replaced our physical IT server environment with a virtualized server environment This upgrade to IT systems is expected to reduce electricity usage

Recycling  

	We monitor print and are committed to reducing the amount of print generated in our operations through the use of electronic communications and reporting We also work to identify print that can be eliminated or reduced
	Paper correspondence received is imaged and filed electronically This allows us to recycle virtually all of the paper received or produced
	Recycling was a focus in the design and materials used in the new building For example, the terrazzo flooring in the new building is made from recycled porcelain plumbing fixtures and the carpeting was manufactured by InterfaceFLOR using 25% post consumer or bio based materials 
	Personal hygiene products used in the restroom facilities are manufactured from recycled or renewable resource paper products

Water Conservation  
	All of the fixtures in the McKinney Texas restroom facilities are low flow fixtures
	Landscaping has been designed using primarily low maintenance native plants to reduce water consumption Sprinkler systems are on timers

General  
	The Companies encourage employees to remain on site and conserve fuel by providing an employee lunch room in which local restaurants cater in lunch

North American Elite Insurance Company," Therefore, it is important that we also take a long-term view on the risk factors that may have an adverse impact on our portfolio, which includes climate change Hence, sustainability and climate change are essential topics for us Our asset management is committed to sustainability and has a well-defined framework which considers ESG criteria, consistently with the Groups Code of Conduct The overall responsibility for responsible investing lies with the Group Chief Investment Officer, supported by the Head Responsible Investing, and the Asset Management Investment Committee Furthermore, an ESG Advisory Board, formed by representatives of all investment units, legal, compliance and risk management, reports on responsible investment activities in the various investment units, develops and reviews improvement ideas, shares knowledge and monitors implementation progress
The Group Asset Management Standard on Responsible Investments (our internal policy) defines our commitment to sustainability The document outlines the principles for all responsible investing activities which include asset classes, investment manager selection, portfolio monitoring and reporting, voting  and engagement (the last two items through the reference to the Swiss Re Voting and Engagement Standard) Swiss Re's strong commitment to sustainability is also defined in our Group-wide Sustainability Risk Framework This framework is applied to the entire investment portfolio, and enables us to identify and analyse potential ESG risks within an investment The framework consists of two umbrella policies on human rights and environmental protection, and seven policies on sensitive sectors or issues: the defense industry; oil and gas (including oil sands); mining; dams; animal testing; forestry and logging; pulp & paper and oil palm; and nuclear weapons proliferation Each policy contains a number of predefined criteria and qualitative standards that may lead to the exclusion of a company or a country from our investment scope 

Our Asset Management unit applies all mentioned criteria to our investment assets, which may lead to the exclusion of a company or a country from our investment scope if they do not meet these criteria and qualitative standards Our exclusion list is reviewed on a regular basis

As a long-term investor, we consider ESG criteria that may have an adverse impact on the sustainable value of our portfolio, such as climate risk and pollution & waste For the systematic and regular assessment of such ESG criteria, we apply sustainability ratings to our investment portfolio Furthermore, based on Swiss Res commitment to support the transition to a low-carbon environment, we measure the weighted average carbon intensity  of our listed equities and credit portfolio on a regular basis since the end of 2015 
In 2017, Swiss Re's Asset Management received the highest rating for its responsible investment approach (""Strategy & Governance"") as well as for the ""Manager Seclection, Appointment and Monitoring"" section Swiss Re scores among the top 15% of all signatories of the United Nations' Principles for Responsible Investments 
ESG considerations per asset class: 

1) Government bonds
Our largest holding within rates products are government bonds (incl agency) At country level, we have implemented a concept of minimum ESG rating standards considering political risk, human rights, and environmental factors that affect the resilience of countries as part of our ESG practice Investments in government bonds hold an ESG rating of BB or better The detailed information is provided by a specialised research company Assessment results guide our responsible investment decisions to ensure the targeted ESG quality of our government bond portfolio This portfolio is screened against such ESG criteria considerations on a monthly basis The sustainability rating is of particular relevance from the perspective of climate change as it measures not only the overall social and governance situation in a country but also its environmental aspects This allows us to consider environmental management in any country in our investment strategy
 
2) Credit products, listed equities, private equity and real estate
At the end of 2018, approximately 46% of our investment portfolio was managed externally This portfolio comprises mainly credit products, equities and hedge funds PRI signatories manage more than 96% of these assets We look at ESG integration primarily from the viewpoint of generating sustainable long-term returns, which aligns well with our focus on a high-quality investment portfolio As part of our active risk management, we are therefore adopting ESG-based benchmarks in our actively managed credit and listed equity portfolios Active credit mandates are benchmarked against Bloomberg Barclays MSCI Corporate Sustainability indices and listed equities are benchmarked against MSCI ACWI ESG Leaders indices, with portfolio managers assessed against outperformance as well as ESG quality of the portfolio
 


Furthermore, all of our external asset managers have contractual provisions with Swiss Re that specifically relate to responsible investing  
We work closely with the external managers to ensure they consider ESG aspects in their investment processes Before external managers are appointed, we perform thorough due diligence to confirm their compliance with our responsible investment principles This includes ESG considerations in investment decisions and monitoring, as well as a review of the managers commitment to responsible investing After being mandated, the managers individual performances are monitored in line with our Responsible Investment Policy and measured against ESG-related benchmarks The managers are required to report regularly on their responsible investment activities

For more systematic and regular monitoring of the actual integration of ESG criteria into our externally managed portfolio, we have engaged the services of a leading ESG research company We conduct in-depth assessments based on ratings provided by them on a regular basis to analyse the quality of the portfolio and to gain further insight into ESG risk exposures We assess the portfolio on the following criteria that are built-up by the factors mentioned below:

Environmental: Climate Change, Natural Resources Use, Waste Management and Environmental Opportunities;

Social: Human Capital, Product Safety, Social Opportunities;

Governance: Corporate Governance, Business Ethics, Government & Public Policy

Results are used to better understand the implications of incorporating ESG considerations into our investment decision-making process and to further improve the quality of our investment portfolio

In 2016, we started to divest from companies that generate 30% or more of their revenues from thermal coal mining or that use at least 30% thermal coal for power generation The decision was taken to mitigate the risk of coal related assets becoming devalued or stranded over the long-term The decision resulted in over USD 13 billion divestments and a significant decrease in carbon intensities in both the credit and the listed equity portfolios For more information, please see Swiss Re's Annual Report 2018, p 174f

We recently also developed and implemented a policy covering mining companies that produce 20m tons of coal per year or more, and existing power generation capacity with installed coal-fire capacity of at least 10 GW, which has not yet been publicly stated
 
Furthermore, we actively contribute to a low carbon economy by investing in the growing SSA (sovereigns, supranational and agencies) green bond market, primarily relying on ICMA's Green Bond Principles As part of our commitment to sustainability, we also invest in green bonds in our credit mandates, as well as renewables and social infrastructure in our infrastructure private debt mandates Debt raised through green bonds is used to finance environmental responsible projects that provide clear benefits from that perspective In 2018, we achieved our target of having a green bond portfolio worth at least USD 15 billion Swiss Re is committed to act as an advocate of long-term investments in infrastructure, as reflected by collaborating with, and advising, the World Banks recently established Global Infrastructure Facility Infrastructure debt is an attractive asset class for a long-term investor like Swiss Re Improving energy efficiency and developing low-carbon technologies, including renewable energy sources, are critical to reducing carbon emissions and securing future energy supplies Renewables and social infrastructure investments are therefore the largest sub-sector in our infrastructure mandate with 21% in renewable energy and 23% in social infrastructure 
Direct private equity investment professionals consider ESG issues when reviewing new Private Equity investment opportunities and are responsible to closely monitor the portfolio of direct private equity investments with respect to ESG issues They actively engage with the management team of the portfolio companies whenever it is deemed necessary in line with Swiss Re's duty as significant minority shareholder

New investments are only made into Private Equity funds that adhere to ESG guidelines and exclusion lists, such as thermal coal exclusions ESG considerations are systematically included to the Investment Memorandum ESG considerations at investee company level are reviewed and discussed as part of an annual deep dive analysis and meeting This includes an update on any changes based on discussions and information received from investee companies' management teams

In Swiss Re's real estate investments, sustainability criteria play an essential role We apply ambitious sustainability standards For projects in Switzerland, the applicable criteria are defined in the Energy Mission Statement of Swiss Re This stipulates that all new buildings need to conform to the MINERGIE standard (wwwminergiech), a Swiss quality label specifying high levels of energy efficiency and superior user comfort When an existing building is due for renovation, this standard applies whenever it is feasible from an architectural, technical and financial point of view In Q2 2018, the combined value of our MINERGIE®-certified buildings reached USD 04 billion, or 23% of our Swiss portfolio of direct real estate investments  Furthermore, we also invest in the US, UK and Australian real estate markets, reaching a total size of USD 17 billion by the end of 2018

The investment managers approach to sustainability includes GreenGuide: Sustainable Property Operations, a best practice guideline for sustainable and efficient real estate operations; ULI GreenPrint Foundation, a global environmental management platform; and LEED Certification from the US Green Building Council The US portfolio is also benchmarked against GRESB, a relative benchmark reliant on performance of all submitting entities The portfolio outperformed the GRESB average of 68/100 with a score of 78/100

LM Insurance Corporation,"  Liberty Mutual has a comprehensive Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) program that has oversight from both executive management and the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors

A major component of the Companys ERM program is management of natural catastrophe risk from events such as hurricanes, earthquakes, and severe thunderstorms, tornadoes, hail, floods, wildfires, drought, and other natural catastrophes   The Company closely monitors changes to the frequency and severity of weather-related natural catastrophes, as well as changing demographic patterns (eg coastal migration) which could increase potential exposure to climate risk  Liberty Mutual rigorously manages its natural catastrophe exposures through its ERM program, utilizing the latest exposure simulation models from AIR and Risk Management Solutions  As such, Liberty Mutual incorporates the most up to date scientific advances in the estimation of the Companys natural catastrophe exposures  

A vital function of ERM is establishing exposure and loss thresholds for natural catastrophe events and ensuring the amount of capital at risk does not exceed these thresholds  By using both the exposure simulation models, as well as historical loss trend data, Liberty Mutual is able to estimate losses for natural catastrophe events of various magnitudes and probabilities  This information is incorporated into strategic planning, pricing, and reinsurance purchasing decisions  Reinsurance products, which include traditional reinsurance, catastrophe bonds, and other risk transfer mechanisms, are used to ensure that the Companys net losses (and capital at risk) associated with significant natural catastrophe events does not exceed established thresholds

For internal ERM purposes, when evaluating the potential financial impact of losses related to hurricane exposures (the largest component of natural catastrophe exposures), Liberty Mutual utilizes a warm sea surface temperature (WSST) event catalog  This WSST event catalog incorporates the estimated increase in frequency and severity of hurricanes in response to sea surface temperatures that are higher than the long-term historical average  This ensures that Liberty Mutual is taking a conservative view of natural catastrophe risk and exposed capital

Another vital component of the ERM program is the monitoring and management of emerging liability risks  Liberty Mutual has a dedicated complex and emerging risks unit responsible for monitoring emerging risks and handling emerging risk claims, including climate change related risk and claims

Oversight of investment portfolio risks is also a component of the ERM program, as well as the Investment Committee of the Board of Directors

PENN MUTUAL LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY,"  The goal was to reduce our carbon footprint, raise associate awareness, develop IT life cycle management, and continue our current recycling program with new eco-friendly initiatives

The Going Green Team was established with an objective to investigate opportunities to reduce the environmental impact of our business operation  This included making our current recycling program more comprehensive and robust, reducing our energy consumption, using sustainable paper products, purchasing equipment with energy star ratings, and doing business with vendors who certify sustainability in disposal of equipment

Reducing energy consumption reduces greenhouse gases and expenses  By reprogramming our building management system that controls our HVAC (heating, ventilation, air conditioning) and lighting controls, migrating Data Center equipment to Blade technology and to a virtualization server environment we have reduced our energy consumption by and average of 620,000 kilowatt hours and our HVAC condenser water system by 202,000 gallons per year

Procurement for both building and technology products and equipment contributes to reducing our carbon footprint  All of our copiers were replaced with energy efficient equipment that will reduce energy and the copiers were set to default to duplex (double sided) printing which reduces paper usage  40 network printers were replaced with energy efficient printers and all monitors were replaced with LCD flat screens  All replaced equipment was disposed through a certified vendor or sold to our associates

Penn Mutual continues to recycle an average of 43 tons per year, which includes mixed office paper, confidential shredding, cardboard, aluminum, glass, tin and plastic  Paper towel, toilet paper and soap dispensers and products were replaced to reduce consumption  Paper towel consumption was reduced by 30%, toilet paper product was changed with a product that reduced packaging by 96% and hand soap was changed from liquid to foam which reduced consumption by 57%

All toilet flushometers were replaced with auto flush devices which reduce water usage  All restroom faucets were replaced with automatic devices to reduce water consumption

At Penn Mutual, we are currently renovating our corporate facility in Horsham PA An important part of our renovation is to reduce the amount of trash that is sent to the landfills By partnering with Revolution Recovery and the Paul Restall Company we have been able to divert 8213% or 11153 tons of construction waste from landfills Items recycled included carpet, ceiling tiles, light bulbs and commingled metal, wood, plastics, drywall, fiberglass and salvages materials which is donated or sold to woodworkers, artists, homeowners and non pro-profits for reuse

"CHA HMO, Inc."," As our business evolves to respond to healthcare reform in the United States  through integrated healthcare delivery and operational cost reductions  we are transforming our business strategy to be more agile and responsive to current healthcare trends For example: strategically selecting and managing our changing real estate portfolio of office properties and associated services (such as data centers), expanding our number of medical clinics, and other new facility concepts are core to our success in responding to changing market demands and to the impacts of climate change We have invested staff resources and capital funds to manage risks and opportunities presented by the rising costs of fossil fuel-based energy and to improve building energy efficiency 

Addressing and collecting data on energy usage and intensity in these facilities supports our greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction goals We have committed that by end of 2022, Humana will achieve a 21%YOY decrease (cumulative 105%) in greenhouse gas emissions from 2017 baseline emissions across our portfolio of owned and leased properties under direct Humana control This goal utilizes the suggested annual reduction based on CDPs science-based target methodology, however is considered a bridge goal due to the shorter target timeframe We support our goals by collecting data on building energy efficiency and green building features when considering new spaces to purchase or lease

To this end, Humana prioritizes support given to energy and emissions reduction projects Humana initiated several large-scale lighting retrofit projects in 2016-2018 at our largest owned facilities, which are projected to reduce annual energy costs by $945,800 In addition, our design standards team, architect and engineering consultants, and facilities team collaborated in 2016 to develop a comprehensive set of design standards for office and clinical operations to ensure consistency, energy efficiency, and sustainable practices across new builds and renovations We are also exploring renewable energy options to determine opportunity and feasibility 

We also partnered with a local electric company to participate in a Demand Response Program On high-energy use days, Humana curbs our electricity usage by turning off common areas and exterior lighting as well as adjusting back-of-the-house systems and asking employees to turn off any unnecessary power consumption  such as desk lamps Not only does this program reduce demand on the regional electrical grid, but it also raises awareness of sensible energy consumption among our employees  We also installed solar panels and reduced our carbon imprint through increased efficiency of our heating and air conditioning systems and software settings that turns off personal computers when theyre not being used

A team of internal and external specialists, coordinated by the Sustainability & Operations Manager, provides expertise on opportunities to reduce costs and emissions through operational efficiency and employee engagement on sustainability  In order to identify appropriate goals related to climate impact, and to track progress toward them, Humana calculates and publicly reports Scope 1, Scope 2, and Scope 3 emissions in accordance with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol  The company provides transparency into this goal, and progress toward it, by voluntarily reporting to CDP and the Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI), in addition to producing a publicly-available Corporate Social Responsibility report

Additionally, Unum has the following processes in place to ensure that our direct and indirect activities that influence policy, mainly through trade associations, are consistent with our overall climate change strategies:

Associations play an instrumental role in disseminating the importance of sustainability and transparency to organizations worldwide By sharing guidance, best practices and information with their members, and even by engaging in the development of reporting rules, associations are helping make a difference to the sustainability performance of thousands of companies Association members help the trade associations to identify innovative approaches they and their members could adopt to face the worlds current sustainability challenges From new ways of approaching income creation to protecting the worlds resources and educating the next generation of business leaders, associations can inspire their members to move the sustainability agenda forward Boards are increasingly being challenged on a range of sustainability related topics and the collaboration between trade organizations about the benefits of integrating sustainability into core business activities, as well as reporting on performance to the markets is an integral step in the process
 Organizations work with associations to reach all companies in the world and encourage them to be transparent about their sustainability performance By doing so, they can increase the value they offer their members, helping their organizations navigate todays sustainability challenges In addition, active associations can be at the forefront of CC legislation and the development process of reporting and sustainability integration

Unum leverages trade associations for sustainability best practices, staying abreast of the latest research, and methods to align our facilities to have a lesser impact on CC Because we are interested in minimizing climate change and continually evolving sustainable practices, we participate in various activities that may influence policy They are, but not limited to, the following:
 Participation in association roundtable discussions
 Partnership/networking with other organizations and leaders to share knowledge and best practices
 Benchmarking analytics to ensure sustainability alignment with like organizations
 Research tools and resources to ensure we are knowledgeable on the latest CC research, products, services, and literature

The Nationwide companies face several potential business risks associated with climate change including:
 Potential volatility in results due to possible increased frequency and/or severity of weather-related catastrophic losses;
 Regulatory constraints on charging appropriate rates that take into account possible weather changes and related losses that are not reflected by historical statistics; 
 Market share of business being adversely impacted due to a disproportionate growth of population and property along coastal areas; 
 Catastrophic losses not limited to coastal areas potentially becoming more frequent (as in hurricane-related losses in the Midwest);
 Disparate impact of climate change on certain insured segments either directly (such as agriculture), or through regulation (eg heavy industry due to emissions) These insured segments could be significantly impacted which could in turn affect the companys business; and 
 Availability and cost of risk transfer options (Reinsurance, Cat Bonds, Cat Swaps, etc)

As we go to market with different initiatives, geographic diversification is one of the factors taken into consideration Additionally, Nationwide maintains sizable investment portfolios which might be impacted by climate change Therefore, consideration is given to the potential impacts of climate change on the investment portfolio

As many of these risks cross boundaries, the risk assessment needs to consider the correlation of the risk across the entire enterprise

Penn Mutual Life Insurance Company,"  The goal is to continually reduce our carbon footprint, raise associate awareness, develop IT life cycle management to continue our current recycling program with new eco-friendly initiatives, several of which, are listed below:

	The previously established, Penn Environmental Awareness Team is annually tasked to investigate opportunities and standardizing methods for reducing the environmental impact of our business operations  This included continuously improving our current recycling program to become more comprehensive and robust while also reducing our energy consumption Methods include using sustainable paper products, purchasing equipment with energy star ratings, and doing business with vendors who certify sustainability in disposal of equipment

	Reducing energy consumption by reducing greenhouse gases and expenses  With continually refining our Building Management System (BAS), which controls our HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning) and lighting controls, we have reduced our electrical consumption for FY17 to an average of 299,001-kilowatt hours/ month from 307,467 KWH/ month FY16 Our Natural Gas consumption has also decreased to an average of 1,248 CCF/ month FY17 from an average of 1,299 CCF/ Month FY16 

	Continually enhancing and improving our operating methods of the chilled water loop system, our water usage for the HVAC system has been reduced by 22,426 gallons/ year for 2018 

	We reduce energy consumption and expenses by optimizing interior heating and cooling, we have continued monitored critical weather and cooling data for outdoor conditions of temperature, humidity, wind chill/ heat index, wind speed/ direction and comparing/ recording these conditions against the HVAC cooling loop temperature needs and making the necessary adjustments Data is being recorded and monitored in 20-minute increments  24/7 The objective for this data collection is used for optimizing the Building Automation System (BAS) to adjust critical temperature set points of the heating/ cooling system

	Penn Mutual has completed the final phase of renovating our corporate facility in Horsham Pa An integral part of this renovation plan was for the reduction for trash that would be sent to landfills To date, we have been able to divert 8100% or 46957 tons of construction waste from landfills Items recycled included carpet, ceiling tiles, light bulbs and commingled metal, wood, plastics, drywall, fiberglass and salvages materials, which is donated or sold to woodworkers, artists, homeowners and non pro-profits for reuse All used office furniture is donated to non-profits, startup companies or recycled

"Essent  Guaranty, Inc.",  Essent does not believe that climate change presents material risks for the Company,5
Swiss Re Life & Health America Inc.," A central pillar of the strategy is to reduce its carbon footprint In 2003, Swiss Re became the first major financial player to commit to going carbon neutral

Our strategy to tackle climate change rests on four pillars, one of which is our pledge to reduce our own CO2 emissions Our Greenhouse Neutral Program has been the principal initiative to achieve this goal Originally launched in 2003 for a ten-year period, it combined two commitments:  firstly, to reduce our CO2 emissions per employee (full-time equivalent or FTE) by a specified  amount;  secondly, to fully offset all the remaining emissions by purchasing high-quality emission reduction credits, thus making the company greenhouse neutral for the whole period between 2003 and 2013 Over the course of the ten years, we gradually raised our reduction target from 15% to 45% per employee By the end of the programs first cycle in 2013, we had achieved a total reduction in CO2 emissions per employee of 493% compared to the base year 2003 Our new target is to keep our CO2 emissions per employee stable at the level of 2013 In view of our expansive business strategy, especially in high growth markets, we consider this to be an ambitious goal 

For the programs second cycle, we also extended the scope of our emissions reporting and of our offsetting commitment In addition to our Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions (heating and power consumption) and a major source of Scope 3 emissions (business travel), our reporting now covers further activities along our supply chain (Scope 3): employee commuting, copy paper use, waste generation, water use and technical gases Based on this, we extended our commitment to offset the CO2 emissions we cannot avoid to paper, waste, water and technical gases In 2017, total CO2 emissions per employee (FTE) decreased by 56% and were thus 19% lower than in 2013 We achieved this reduction mainly by switching to renewable power in some of our Asian locations by further cutting our energy intensity, eg through more efficient heating Swiss Re has implemented a number of projects that reduce our environmental footprint:

	First, we have made continuous efforts to lower the actual amount of energy consumed per employee, ie to reduce our energy intensity In the first phase of our Greenhouse Neutral Programme, we set ourselves a 20% reduction target compared with 2003 levels, measured in kWh per employee Through many small measures to improve energy efficiency and by concentrating backoffice tasks in fewer and more energy-efficient buildings, we actually achieved a reduction of 465% by 2013 For the second phase of our Greenhouse Neutral Programme (base year 2013), our commitment is to continuously reduce energy intensity by 2% per year As a matter of fact, our energy intensity was 243% lower at the end of 2017 than in 2013 Partly, we achieved this by decommissioning existing office buildings and moving into more energy-efficient ones In 2017 we completed Swiss Re Next at the Group's headquarters in Zurich which replaced the decommissioned Neubau building
	Second, going one step further, we have recently started to build our own solar power facilities Following earlier projects in Italy, Switzerland and the UK, we launched in 2016 a large facility at our Armonk Americas headquarters Comprising ten acres of ground-mounted panels, the facility has a capacity of two megawatts, sufficient to supply more than 60% of the sites power requirements 

	Third, whenever possible, we purchase power from renewable sources This has been a key measure of our Greenhouse Neutral Programme After starting to use renewable power at four European locations in 2005, we set ourselves the goal of using 100% renewable power at all locations where it is available in reliable and trustworthy quality by the end of 2013 Based on our quality assessments of available energy sources, we believe we reached this goal and used 100% renewable power at 25 locations in Asia, Europe, North America and Oceania as per the end of 2013 At the end of 2017, approximately 84% of the power we purchased across the Group came from renewable energy sources We are committed to raising this figure to 100% 
	Fourth, as a result of the substantial cuts we have achieved in CO2 emissions from power consumption and heating since 2003, business travel easily constitutes Swiss Res largest emissions source today We continuously monitor all travel budgets and collect travel data centrally We have taken several measures to reduce the need for business travel and to curb unnecessary business trips: (1) We have built up a dense network of video conferencing equipment across the Group Recently, we partly replaced these facilities with state-of-the-art video presence technology, which creates a real-time, life-size virtual meeting experience in specially designed rooms By the end of 2017, we had a total of 170 video presence facilities worldwide (2) Furthermore, we introduced an internal carbon levy on air travel in 2014, which uses the polluter pays principle It allocates the costs of the Voluntary Emissions Reductions (VERs) that we need to buy to offset our CO2 emissions to the Groups Global Functions in proportion to their respective share of air travel (previously they had been borne centrally by Group Finance) This internal price on carbon heightens awareness of travel costs among our managers and employees and creates a further incentive to reduce air travel, in addition to flight costs Despite these measures, the amount of kilometres travelled per employee and the associated emissions rose in past years A key driver is our continued expansion in high growth markets, which has brought an increase in teams distributed across different locations In 2017, the total distance each of our employees travelled has stabilized and on average increased by just 04% compared with previous year
	Fifth, the second commitment of our Greenhouse Neutral Programme is to compensate all CO2 emissions we cannot avoid For the seven emissions sources covered in the second phase of our Greenhouse Neutral Programme, we bought and retired VERs for a total of 80,780 tonnes of CO2 in 2016 We are keen to ensure that the VERs we buy are of a high environmental standard Therefore, we have developed a set of criteria to select projects that generate certificates In particular, we give priority to those which create strong social side-effects and benefit the poorest regions

Horace Mann Property and Casualty Insurance Company,"	A greener home office:
Horace Mann has virtualized approximately 700 servers in our Springfield data center, 200 systems in several IT Hosting Service Providers, for a total of approximately 900 systems including servers and workstations This has reduced our annual energy consumption by 59 million kWh and our CO2 emissions by an estimated 94 million pounds each year Estimates were calculated from statistics provided by the VMWare Green Calculator
Horace Mann utilizes an energy management system that allows proactive scheduling of lights and heating/ventilation/air conditioning allowing setbacks during non-core hours Light sensors have been installed in various areas allowing for lights out when not in use Our workstations are turned off on a schedule or when not in use, which provides not only energy efficiency; but also a cost savings to the company Our printers are set to use double-sided printing to cut our per-page paper consumption in half They also have a sleep schedule to reduce power consumption during non-office hours The majority of printers are black and white printers with less access to color printers, thus reserving color ink usage; the black and white copiers are the default setting for all machines 
As updates to the building and related grounds continue; energy-efficient ballasts are used in all ceiling lights where possible and LED lighting is used throughout the building Window and solar shades have been installed and maintained in various areas of the building to reduce the solar load and reduce cooling costs There are additional ongoing initiatives to curtail print output resulting in reduced electrical consumption and heat output Plans are also in place to replace legacy equipment with more energy efficient solutions

In 2018, Horace Mann entered into a contract with a new vendor to operate the companys onsite cafeteria and catering The new vendor has successfully eliminated the use of Styrofoam containers and plates in the home office They have replaced them with reusable plates and utensils that eliminate the amount of waste the company produces 

b	Home Office Recycling:
Recycling bins are located on all levels of the building in multiple, convenient areas of the office to remind employees to recycle first We encourage our employees to participate in recycling the following materials: paper, plastic, metal, cardboard, and printer cartridges 
The company also hosts an annual shred day for employees to bring materials in for shredding from home, which are then recycled
We recycle all computer equipment that is not functional, through a certified vendor All recycling or disposals of items beyond repair are conducted in accordance with environmental restrictions and have that adherence as part of the contract We donate functional equipment to a local, education servicing 501c3 entity
In conjunction with our corporate social responsibility efforts, Horace Mann currently partners in a vocational program with the Hope Institute in Springfield, Illinois as an employer of students The Hope Learning Academy, a division of the Hope Institutes, is a center that combines teaching, technology and a specially designed facility to allow students with varying developmental disabilities to achieve their maximum potential Part of their responsibilities within the program are the collection of recyclables; plastic bottles are collected and sent to the corporate recycling company and aluminum cans are delivered to the local recycling facility for processing The proceeds from the aluminum recycling program is given to the school to assist with school dances and other group events  

c	Educating  employees and customers
 Internal intranet articles are periodically published to remind employees to be conscious of energy consumption and to be diligent in turning off computer monitors and shelf lights when leaving for the night 
We encourage clients to register for online account access and claims reporting; eDelivery of premium notices and correspondence; and Easy Pay electronic payments on auto, property and life policies As we continue to modernize our infrastructure, we expect additional conversions from paper to electronic transmission Current estimates indicate that the company saves around 530,000 pages and nearly 189,000 envelopes by utilizing the eDelivery options

Posts to our Facebook and Twitter pages, emails and articles in our monthly e-newsletters encourage policyholders to participate in green observances and initiatives, such as Earth Day and school recycling programs 

d	Community Social Responsibility
At Horace Mann, we believe the environment is vital to the quality of life of our employees, agents, customers and communities As just one example of our commitment to the environment, our campus headquarters represents one of the largest green spaces in downtown Springfield, IL Our building was designed by world-renowned architect Minoru Yamasaki, who also designed the original World Trade Center in New York City We maintain the award-winning grounds, outdoor seating, fountains and Remembrance Garden for the benefit of both our employees and community

As a major employer in Springfield, our commitment to quality of life extends beyond maintaining and enhancing our award-winning campus In 2016, we purchased a nearby empty building that was in poor repair from the Salvation Army, enabling the charity to renovate another downtown building into a new community center The old Salvation Army building was demolished and is now the site of a new landscaped and fenced employee parking lot This parking lot replaced an adjacent lot, which will now potentially be used as the site for a new public transportation hub
In addition to changes within the structure of the physical Horace Mann building and its campus, interior changes are also taking place to help decrease the need for additional buildings and facilities In late 2017, a home office re-brand and refresh project began to help curb the footprint of our employee base Within this project changes are being made to bring more desk-space to the home office and bring more employees into the building without requiring outside space 

As climate change may increase the prevalence and severity of weather events, Horace Manns website provides information on how to build an emergency preparedness kit as well as the steps to take before and after a disaster strikes It also provides information regarding how to prepare for specific types of potential catastrophes, such as hurricanes, tornados, earthquakes, floods, wildfires, wind, and winter storms Links to related websites (American Red Cross, Federal Emergency Management Agency, National Hurricane Center, and the National Safety Council) are also provided for the convenience of our website visitors

Victoria Automobile Insurance Company," A robust Enterprise Risk Management program identifies potential risks and develops controls to systematically assess the impact of these risks to its business

As part of the detailed risk assessment, Nationwides Enterprise Risk Management team works in collaboration with the business leaders across the multiple businesses to understand the risk that climate change poses over the strategic horizon This process involves identifying exposure for incremental risk and reward as well as assessing the companys capabilities against industry practices Risks associated with climate change as identified through Nationwides risk assessment process are discussed in the response to question four above

In order to measure the risks from certain natural perils potentially associated with climate change, Nationwide licenses the software and support of external catastrophe modeling vendors These vendors constantly review and update their models to incorporate the most recent science available 

These models allow Nationwide to measure their catastrophe exposure and develop a perspective on the potential size and likelihood of various catastrophes These models also allow the Nationwide companies to assess how various strategies will impact this risk including changes to deductibles, changes to market shares and geographic diversification

Specific to the hurricane peril, the major catastrophe modeling vendors have developed alternative event scenario catalogs associated with increased sea surface temperatures which some scientists might attribute to global warming Elevated sea surface temperatures are important because hurricanes are fueled by the warmth of the ocean These alternative event catalogs, therefore, represent a climate-conditioned view of risk This alternate view is used to assess the sensitivity of insured risk to elevated sea surface temperatures 

Beyond the direct output from the models, measurement and sensitivity analysis can be informed by maintaining external partnerships in academia, trade associations, experts from the modeling vendors, and reinsurers and brokers Nationwide has developed these types of external relationships and regularly avails itself of information from these sources as an integral part of the risk management program

Esurance Property and Casualty Insurance Company," The Enterprise Risk and Return Council (""ERRC"") is Allstate's senior risk management committee and includes the CEO, business unit presidents, enterprise and business unit chief risk officers and chief financial officers, general counsel, and treasurer The ERRC convenes monthly to assess and manage risks and opportunities, including topics
related to climate change, which may impact the company

Additionally, Allstate's Sustainability Leadership Committee, composed of officers and senior staff from across the company, meets on a quarterly basis in order to guide environmental efforts from an enterprise wide perspective, build alignment, create momentum for Allstate's heightened sustainability efforts, and identify opportunities associated with environmental responsibility and climate change
The Enterprise Risk and Return Dashboard Report, prepared quarterly for the ERRC, Audit Committee, and the Board of Directors, is one of the tools used to evaluate key risks, strategies, and actions This Dashboard Report allows Allstate to compare risk exposure with the company's enterprise action plan targets by capturing key information and metrics on material issues, such as catastrophic and severe weather events, quarterly auto and property insurance underwriting results, business continuity, disaster recovery plans, and investment concentrations Regulatory changes, customer behavior trends, and Allstate's current public reputation are also considered To the extent climate change results in more natural catastrophic events or an increase in the severity of catastrophe events or both, the cost of reinsurance or other risk transfer mechanisms (eg, catastrophe bonds) is likely to rise, resulting in higher prices or unavailability of property insurance for consumers Emerging risks and opportunities are also identified and reported as part of the quarterly Dashboard reporting process
 
Risks and opportunities are generally assessed at an enterprise or business unit level rather than an asset or localized level The cross-functional Sustainability Leadership Committee ensures that risks and opportunities confronting company assets are considered when evaluating climate change-related risks at the enterprise level The Sustainability Leadership Committee completes an annual review of Allstate's operations, stakeholder expectations, and competitive actions in this space to identify internal opportunities related to climate change The Committee considers potential opportunities related to employee engagement, current and future regulation, improved operational efficiencies, and customer and consumer expectations Allstate's Vice President of Corporate Responsibility, who leads the Sustainability Leadership Committee, reports to the senior -management team on the efforts and assessments of the committee

Climate change, to the extent it produces rising temperatures and changes in weather patterns, could impact the frequency or severity of weather events and wildfires, the affordability and availability of homeowners insurance, the number and severity of claims submitted by our customers, and the results of our Allstate Protection business Property insured by Allstate throughout the United States could be affected by changes in precipitation and extreme droughts

Additionally, there is an opportunity for Allstate to build its reputation for its sustainability efforts among consumers and other key stakeholders who are increasingly interested in the environment and the impacts of climate change on our company This opportunity could enhance customer and consumer consideration thereby potentially increasing Allstate's customer base

Climate change, to the extent it produces rising temperatures and changes in weather patterns, could impact the frequency or severity of weather events and wildfires As a property and casualty insurer, we may face significant losses from catastrophes and severe weather events across the United States We may incur catastrophe losses in our auto and property business in excess of: (1) those experienced in prior years, (2) the average expected level used in pricing, (3) our current reinsurance coverage limits, or (4) the estimated loss from external hurricane and earthquake models at various levels of probability Despite our catastrophe management programs, we are exposed to catastrophes that could have a material effect on operating results and financial condition For example, our historical catastrophe experience includes losses relating to Hurricane Katrina in 2005, which totaled $36 billion, and Hurricane Andrew in 1992, which totaled $23 billion

To the extent that climate change impacts valuation of commercial real estate properties or municipalities in which we invest, our investment results would be impacted Allstate's investments throughout the United States could be affected by risks associated with other physical climate drivers

Increases in claims resulting from future extreme weather events could lead to increased operational costs The highest risk areas are major metropolitan centers in counties along the eastern and gulf coasts of the United States
Property catastrophe exposure management includes purchasing reinsurance to provide coverage for known exposure to hurricanes, earthquakes, wildfires, fires following earthquakes, and other catastrophes We continue to attempt to capture our reinsurance cost in premium rates as allowed by state regulatory authorities To the extent climate change results in more frequent catastrophic weather events, the cost of reinsurance is likely to rise, resulting in higher prices or unavailability of property insurance for consumers
Allstate supports changes in the regulatory environment, including promoting the creation of government sponsored, privately-funded solutions for mega-catastrophes, that will make insurance more available and affordable
Allstate is engaged in an on-going evaluation of climate change as it relates to the company's future risk exposure, which may be affected by the federal government's ability to prepare for and respond to climate¬change-related catastrophes (eg sea-level rise) Allstate regularly monitors all significant enterprise risks and opportunities, including those related to climate change, using fluid risk identification processes that reflect a continuously shifting external and internal risk environment and reports to the Board of Directors, Audit Committee, and ERRC Changes in regulations, customer behavior, Allstate's reputation, and other risks are considered

Assurant purchases forward-looking catastrophe and storm models from several modeling agencies Our in-house meteorologist, hydrologist and catastrophe modelers also work with modeling agencies to help improve Assurants models Assurant employs a proprietary view of risk, which combines and adjusts results from several models to arrive at a comprehensive annual assessment of our climate-related risk, policy rates and reinsurance costs
To enhance our understanding of our significant risk exposure to catastrophic events, we purchase aftermarket information that provides us additional building characteristics, which we include in our modeling process and supply to our panel of more than 40 reinsurers 
We also employ catastrophe models for various geographic regions that contain medium-term (5-year) projections, which allow us to make more accurate assumptions on the frequency of hurricanes or other climate-related events to determine pricing and guide appropriate risk-taking within the Company

American Bankers Life Assurance Company of FL," For many, relocating is not an option 

At Assurant, we believe that with the right approach, we can provide insurance for consumers currently in homes susceptible to extreme weather while maintaining sound actuarial standards Through our lender-placed insurance products, which also serve to protect lenders, consumers are provided the opportunity to secure coverage when other options may not be available Assurant is prepared and committed for the long term to remaining in Florida, for example, as well as other catastrophe-prone areas we service We take a long-term approach that is responsible to consumers, investors and society 

While we provide coverage for homeowners who lose coverage because of climate risk, we do not underwrite private flood policies in repetitive loss zones, as we believe it is important to follow responsible building practices We also educate consumers and regulators about the benefits of adopting climate-resilient improvements when constructing or repairing homes To incentivize these behaviors, where possible we offer discounts for those who have fortified their homes to mitigate the impacts of floods, hurricanes or other severe weather Most of our international home policies offer discounts for customers who build with more resilient materials and install wind mitigation features 

As one of the largest carriers of flood protection in the United States, we offer our customers a full suite of flood protection, including through the National Flood Insurance Program, which is reinsured, and through voluntary flood protection products that we underwrite To responsibly manage this risk, we employ flood specialistssuch as meteorologists, hydrologists and catastrophe modelersand leverage decades of experience to understand the intricacies of flood risk These underwriting practices and research investments support our long-term commitment to consumers who may be impacted by floods 
We continue to innovate new products to better serve our flood customers in the United States For example, we introduced our patent-pending flood coverage add-on, FlexCash, after observing that many consumers struggle with unexpected expenses before a claim payout arrives FlexCash provides an immediate fixed payout up to $10,000 after a flood event is verified using photographs This payment can help ease cash flow constraints that arise while we process a claim In 2017, nearly 70 percent of our voluntary flood polices include FlexCash In 2018, we also began offering limited flood coverage for renters Through the Federal Emergency Management Agencys Community Ratings System, we can discount flood insurance rates if the customer lives in a community that is taking action to mitigate long-term risks 

We also offer index-based insurance in certain geographies susceptible to climate change to protect consumers who are indirectly affected by extreme weather events Index-based insurance provides coverage to businesses that are indirectly impacted by climate change, such as a business owner whose surrounding neighborhood is damaged due to a natural disaster 

To help determine the protection solutions that best support our customers, consumers and the communities in which we operate, we engage with policy makers, government agencies and insurance regulators We work with regulators and state insurance departments to advocate for fair legislation that benefits our clients and end-consumers needs Through this dialogue, we develop new or improved products aligned with public policy interests

HDI-Gerling America Insurance Company,"

In the context of the companys operations, risk management should be viewed from two different standpoints  First, based on the companys physical facilities and method of operation as a property and casualty insurance company whose only product is insurance policies, climate change, in the companys view, does not pose a significant risk to the companys operations and ongoing viability  The companys physical operations are limited to certain office building premises as described above  Those office leases make provision for the climate control, maintenance and habitability of each office space

Second, risk management should be viewed from the standpoint of the company as a commercial property and casualty insurer  The company provides loss control services to policyholders and potential policyholders by which engineers inspect certain policyholder facilities  Such inspections may take emissions and other factors related to climate change into account, and the results of those inspections are factored into the premiums charged to policyholders  Thus, risks related to climate change may be factored into premiums such that the company can use those premiums to mitigate the degree of risk accordingly  Also, in the event of a claim, the company will take facts regarding emissions or climate change into account when setting a reserve so that adequate funds are set aside to respond to the claim  Similarly, the company can also use such claims data to set reserves for claims that are incurred but not reported (IBNR)  The company and its parent group maintain a conservative investment portfolio per the parent groups guidelines, avoiding high-risk investment vehicles and market sectors",1

NATIONWIDE PROP & CAS INS CO," Included within these risk mitigation efforts is the application of fortified standards developed by the Insurance Institute for Business and Home Safety (IBHS) As part of this program, mitigation credits can be earned by our customers thus reducing the premium we charge along with reducing the potential future losses due to weather-type events Nationwide also offers a home inventory process that allows consumers the ability to track their personal belongings for when an unfortunate event occurs In the past, Nationwide has mailed information to our members in high wildfire hazard areas in Western states The mailing provided them with a website and information from IBHS on how to make their homes and businesses safer from wildfire  Nationwide believes that proper hazard mitigation is an effective way to address the increasing threat from wildfire  Nationwide is in the midst of a multi-year process of re-inspecting our portfolio and making risk reduction recommendations to our members on how to mitigate their wildfire hazard

In addition, to continue driving more awareness around the benefits from risk mitigation, Nationwide has implemented a new endorsement focused on replacing roofs to more stringent building requirements at the time of an eligible loss which will result in a more weather-proofed roof IBHS guidance for mitigating property losses is available directly to the public at wwwdisastersafetyorg Increased risk sharing through the utilization of wind/hail deductibles is used to help encourage consumers to proactively mitigate weather claims In addition, Nationwide is active at the local and national level to help drive the necessary building code changes to make homes safer Nationwide is an active member of the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) Wildland and Rural Fire Protection committee This is a committee that develops codes, standards, and recommended practices for fire protection infrastructure used in land development in wildland, rural, and suburban areas

As catastrophe risk increases in certain markets, Nationwide continues to invest in the necessary tools to better understand the risk, whether it be hurricanes, severe thunderstorms or wildfires Financially, the importance of geographic diversification within Nationwides portfolio is one of the key levers to being a successful property insurer Included within this work is the integration of risk management findings into pricing, product development and distribution planning along with consumer education

Along similar lines, Nationwide constructed one of the first ever commercial buildings in San Antonio that is certified as fortified according to IBHS standards and we have also built a second office building to those standards in downtown Columbus The company continues to not only help drive these types of changes within the community but across the different businesses In partnership with home builders, banks, consumers, IBHS and legislatures, the necessary changes will need to occur leading to improvements in building codes and risk management in general
From a commercial standpoint, Nationwide provides education and loss control services to assist customers in identifying risks, ways to mitigate risks along with including exclusionary language for certain risk types within its contracts Through individual risk pricing modifications, those consumers who respond to these services in a positive manner could be eligible for improved pricing consideration

American Mercury Insurance Company,"S and hurricanes in the East  For both of these catastrophic perils, there are predictions of increasing frequency and severity that could be caused by climate change  For Mercury, the greatest exposure to loss that could be influenced by climate change occurs in California with wildfire risk  For hurricane risk, the exposure to loss is greatest in New York and Texas, with lesser exposure in New Jersey, Georgia and Virginia  
A major catastrophic loss would affect Mercury in several ways  First, the company could have exceptionally high demands on the claims staff  Next, the company could experience a severe drain on capital  Third, the company might have to sell investment assets to generate cash at a time when the value of those assets is depressed

Cambia does not have a formal plan to assess, reduce, or mitigate its emissions in its operations or organizations However, Cambia does have a formal sustainability program that seeks to incorporate the triple bottom line framework (economic growth, environmental stewardship, and social equity) into its planning, decision-making, and operations The sustainability program includes efforts to incorporate greater environmental stewardship into company operations Working with Cambias Real Estate and Facilities department, Information Technology (IT), and Human Resources, Cambia has undertaken the following efforts that will result in reduced greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions:
	Information Technology (IT): There are several efforts within Cambias IT infrastructure where technology and date center infrastructure changes have resulted in efficiencies directed at power, cooling, and space:
o	Major cooling upgrade to Salt Lake City data center
o	Switch to more efficient servers
o	Server virtualization
o	Mainframe consolidation
o	Increased data storage efficiencies
o	Replace firewall infrastructure with a more energy-efficient system
o	Replaced load balancer infrastructure with a more energy-efficient system
o	Upgraded our call center telephone system
o	Recycle eWaste though a BAN-certified eCycler
o	Shift to print on demand and double-sided paper
	Real Estate and Facilities:
o	Replaced aging HVAC system (boilers and chillers) with more energy efficient system
o	Established standardized HVAC temperature set points, to maximize unit efficiencies, which reduced energy consumption
o	Implemented daylight harvesting in Burlington, and implementing in locations when remodels occur
o	Changed lighting in Salem garage from sodium vapor to fluorescent
o	Received Energy Star certification in 2 locations (Burlington and Tacoma), tracking energy use in all locations through Energy Star
o	Contracting with a janitorial vendor that uses proprietary green cleaners and microfiber towels to reduce waste
o	Renovating and maintaining our office space through use of low VOC paints and carpets, purchasing products with recycled content, reusing materials and furniture where possible, recycling materials such as carpet
o	Conducting waste audits to assess the waste stream and identify opportunities to reduce waste and increase recycling 
	Human Resources
o	Reducing our actual footprint through telework and mobile work arrangements An estimated 20% of Cambia employees now work remotely This initiative has reduced/eliminated commutes for these employees with a commensurate reduction in emissions (We have not measured the reduced emissions or other environmental benefits of this shift to remote and mobile work) While we expect this effort to have decreased emissions, we recognized that there is some displacement of emissions to employees who are now lighting, heating, and cooling their homes during the day when they are working from home
o	Cambia has a strong commute reimbursement program that subsidizes public transit passes and carpooling
o	Cambia also has a strong bike commuter program that encourages employees to bike to work The bike commuter program provides support to all levels of riders such as beginning bike commuters through a bike buddy program, various bike-commuting workshops and a resource-rich Bike Commuters site on Spark, the company intranet Cambia participates in May Bike to Work Month and the Bike Commute Challenge in September

No - The company is not taking actions to manage the risks climate change poses to the business - Please describe why	

We will continue to mitigate our risks (eg, not writing homeowner policies in hurricane-prone coastal states or those at high risk of wildfire) as they emerge  

California Casualty models a number of perils (fire-following EQ, tornado/hail, winter storm, and hurricane, and wildfire) which could be affected by climate change Given our improved surplus position, we increased our retention from $10 million to $14 million for our 2021 Catastrophe reinsurance program

Climate change, including global warming and sea-level rise, is expected to result in increased annual variability in weather-related events, including wildfires, convective storms, winter storms, hurricanes and floods   Damage resulting from such events is generally covered by policies underwritten by California Casualty members and California Casualty has instituted a number of methods to limit its exposure to such losses, including the following:
1	Product Distribution 
a	Auto-only in Florida, Mississippi, Louisiana, South Carolina and Texas
2	Product
a	Several years ago, in 20 wind-prone states, older home roofs are covered at ACV, instead of at replacement cost We continue to replace the ACV roof coverage with scheduled roof coverage in wind-prone states to further reduce wind losses In addition, the scheduled roof coverage has been expanded to additional states
3	Underwriting 
a	Minimum distance-to-coast underwriting acceptability rules for Property risks located in Alabama, Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, New Jersey, Rhode Island, and Virginia
b	Use of ISO Fire Line to qualify new Property risks in Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Oregon, Utah, Washington and Wyoming 
4	Pricing 
a	Effective 4/1/2014, rates are varied by ISO Fire Line scores in California Subsequently, Fire Line score rating was implemented in nine states
b	In new rating plans, rates are varying by roof type and age  Effective dates vary by state
c	Introduced higher deductible options
d	Starting from 4/1/2014, the company has been rolling out new by-peril rating plans for homeowners policies As of 6/30/2021, 33 states have this plan, which represent 99% of the homeowners policies
e	Starting from 12/1/2021, the company plans to further refine its rating plans by splitting its rating perils  As a result, wildfire and weather-related water damages will be rated separately
5	Monitoring exposure concentration
a	RMS Terrorism analysis used as surrogate for non-modeled perils, such as wildfire or riot & civil commotion
b	Coastal exposures are monitored on a regular basis
6	Catastrophe Risk Modeling 
a	RMS:  earthquake, fire-following EQ, tornado/hail, winter storm, hurricane
b	AIR:  earthquake, fire-following EQ, tornado/hail, winter storm, hurricane, and wildfire

Foremost Property and Casualty Insurance Company,"  We publish materials for agents and customers that provide information about tornado and hurricane safety, fire safety and disaster recovery  We also make home inventory materials available, which customers may use to establish a record of their belongings  Some of these publications are available in other languages

Some of our officers are involved with organizations that have interests that intersect, or overlap with, the interests of organizations that focus on climate change  Examples are the Institute for Business and Home Safety (IBHS), the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, and the Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety  For example, IBHS works to reduce the social and economic effects of natural disasters and other property losses by conducting research and advocating improved construction, maintenance and preparation practices  

Some experts believe that climate changes have the potential to affect the frequency and severity of wildfire  Fire, by emitting greenhouse gases and aerosols, is also thought to contribute to overall global warming  Some researchers predict that in temperate regions, including the western United States, higher temperatures will extend wildfire seasons, with more occurring earlier and later in any given year  Farmers is active in multiple fire safety, prevention and training boards  These include the California State Board of Fire Services, which provides a forum for addressing fire protection and prevention issues  We also participate in the Fire Safe Council, which provides resources for establishing and maintaining local Councils, and the Fire Safety Institute, which focuses on providing quality firefighter training and promoting firefighter safety",5

Civil Service employees Insurance Co.," 
Climate changes can be classified as gradual and abrupt changes As part of our risk assessment, we review the companys need for rate/coverage adjustments considering frequency and severity trends, including among other factors the effect of climate changes on said trends Every year, we work with our reinsurance broker on catastrophe models to determine the reinsurance coverage needed and adjust our program accordingly These models are updated annually by experts to incorporate the latest information 
As it relates to investment management, the company views the market as efficient and as such, known risks, including those posed by climate changes, are fairly reflected in current prices The company recognizes that direct and indirect investment in real estate present the risk that physical assets may be in areas with increased risks of wildfires, floods, rising sea level, hurricanes and other climate change related perils that could result in loss of asset value These risks are complex and could result in value losses from destruction or damages of property, but also due to cost of preventive measures, business interruption, insurance premium and interest rate increases The impact would be felt across most investments and more directly in MBS, pass-through securities, REIT and financial services The company keeps a diversified portfolio with 9% in securities directly related to real estate (including 7% from government agencies) and 10% in financial services Sectors with significant carbon footprint may also have significant exposures not only due to property and potential business interruption, but possibly product and environmental liability as well as changing regulatory environment Our exposure to utilities, oil, gas and pipeline represent 4% of invested assets Municipal bonds are another potential source of risk as municipalities face increasing pressure and ultimate costs to adapt to the impacts of climate change 18% of the portfolio is in municipal bonds spread across 26 states with no state greater than 15% of the portfolio
In the meantime, it is also important to note that climate changes could impact negatively every sector and on the reverse side that individual companies within all these sectors could offer investment upsides as they may participate in established and emerging sectors that could help to mitigate climate, such as activities related to renewable energy, energy efficiency technology, climate change mitigation technology and energy storage

Allstate Insurance Group," The Enterprise Risk and Return Council (""ERRC"") is Allstate's senior risk management committee and includes the CEO, business unit presidents, enterprise and business unit chief risk officers and chief financial officers, general counsel, and treasurer The ERRC convenes monthly to assess and manage risks and opportunities, including topics
related to climate change, which may impact the company

Additionally, Allstate's Sustainability Leadership Committee, composed of officers and senior staff from across the company, meets on a quarterly basis in order to guide environmental efforts from an enterprise wide perspective, build alignment, create momentum for Allstate's heightened sustainability efforts, and identify opportunities associated with environmental responsibility and climate change

The Enterprise Risk and Return Dashboard Report, prepared quarterly for the ERRC, Audit Committee, and the Board of Directors, is one of the tools used to evaluate key risks, strategies, and actions This Dashboard Report allows Allstate to compare risk exposure with the company's enterprise action plan targets by capturing key information and metrics on material issues, such as catastrophic and severe weather events, quarterly auto and property insurance underwriting results, business continuity, disaster recovery plans, and investment concentrations Regulatory changes, customer behavior trends, and Allstate's current public reputation are also considered To the extent climate change results in more natural catastrophic events or an increase in the severity of catastrophe events or both, the cost of reinsurance or other risk transfer mechanisms (eg, catastrophe bonds) is likely to rise, resulting in higher prices or unavailability of property insurance for consumers Emerging risks and opportunities are also identified and reported as part of the quarterly Dashboard reporting process
 
Risks and opportunities are generally assessed at an enterprise or business unit level rather than an asset or localized level The cross-functional Sustainability Leadership Committee ensures that risks and opportunities confronting company assets are considered when evaluating climate change-related risks at the enterprise level The Sustainability Leadership Committee completes an annual review of Allstate's operations, stakeholder expectations, and competitive actions in this space to identify internal opportunities related to climate change The Committee considers potential opportunities related to employee engagement, current and future regulation, improved operational efficiencies, and customer and consumer expectations Allstate's Vice President of Corporate Responsibility, who leads the Sustainability Leadership Committee, reports to the senior -management team on the efforts and assessments of the committee

Climate change, to the extent it produces rising temperatures and changes in weather patterns, could impact the frequency or severity of weather events and wildfires, the affordability and availability of homeowners insurance, the number and severity of claims submitted by our customers, and the results of our Allstate Protection business Property insured by Allstate throughout the United States could be affected by changes in precipitation and extreme droughts

Additionally, there is an opportunity for Allstate to build its reputation for its sustainability efforts among consumers and other key stakeholders who are increasingly interested in the environment and the impacts of climate change on our company This opportunity could enhance customer and consumer consideration thereby potentially increasing Allstate's customer base

Climate change, to the extent it produces rising temperatures and changes in weather patterns, could impact the frequency or severity of weather events and wildfires As a property and casualty insurer, we may face significant losses from catastrophes and severe weather events across the United States We may incur catastrophe losses in our auto and property business in excess of: (1) those experienced in prior years, (2) the average expected level used in pricing, (3) our current reinsurance coverage limits, or (4) the estimated loss from external hurricane and earthquake models at various levels of probability Despite our catastrophe management programs, we are exposed to catastrophes that could have a material effect on operating results and financial condition For example, our historical catastrophe experience includes losses relating to Hurricane Katrina in 2005, which totaled $36 billion, and Hurricane Andrew in 1992, which totaled $23 billion

To the extent that climate change impacts valuation of commercial real estate properties or municipalities in which we invest, our investment results would be impacted Allstate's investments throughout the United States could be affected by risks associated with other physical climate drivers

Increases in claims resulting from future extreme weather events could lead to increased operational costs The highest risk areas are major metropolitan centers in counties along the eastern and gulf coasts of the United States

Property catastrophe exposure management includes purchasing reinsurance to provide coverage for known exposure to hurricanes, earthquakes, wildfires, fires following earthquakes, and other catastrophes We continue to attempt to capture our reinsurance cost in premium rates as allowed by state regulatory authorities To the extent climate change results in more frequent catastrophic weather events, the cost of reinsurance is likely to rise, resulting in higher prices or unavailability of property insurance for consumers

Allstate supports changes in the regulatory environment, including promoting the creation of government sponsored, privately-funded solutions for mega-catastrophes, that will make insurance more available and affordable

Allstate is engaged in an on-going evaluation of climate change as it relates to the company's future risk exposure, which may be affected by the federal government's ability to prepare for and respond to climate¬change-related catastrophes (eg sea-level rise) Allstate regularly monitors all significant enterprise risks and opportunities, including 
those related to climate change, using fluid risk identification processes that reflect a continuously shifting external and internal risk environment and reports to the Board of Directors, Audit Committee, and ERRC Changes in regulations, customer behavior, Allstate's reputation, and other risks are considered

Carolina Casualty Insurance Company,"  This is done both by monitoring the aggregate exposures and by the use of computer modeling of such losses
	No such computer modeling is available for the business written within Berkley Life as this business is not subject to losses arising from natural catastrophes 
	All USA property business written in the Group is modeled within computer models developed specifically for this purpose  The Group licenses one vendor model, and outsources modeling in a second vendor model to provide a second perspective on catastrophe risk
	The results of the computer modeling are examined at Group level, at individual operating company level, and at individual policy level 
	The ERM team identifies to both senior management and to our operating companies those locations and policies which are most likely to give rise to a substantial loss from hurricane  Operating companies are expected to take appropriate action on any policy that gives rise to too great a catastrophe exposure; such actions may include the introduction of peril-specific deductibles and / or sublimits, the non-renewal of specific policies, the re-underwriting of particular segments of the portfolio, and the purchase of additional reinsurance protection
	The computer modeling results are discussed each quarter by the Group ERM committee
	The computer modeling results are used as part of the Groups assessment of its (ceded) reinsurance strategy  This reinsurance protects the Group if a damaging event should occur
	The ERM and Catastrophe teams investigate the possibility of model miss within vendor catastrophe models; this includes a comparison of modeled industry losses against revalued historic losses, investigation of individual sub-components within the model, and stress testing model frequency and severity assumptions

Indemnity Ins Co of North America," Standard & Poors rating of Chubbs enterprise risk management process as Strong in its June 2018 ERM rating report places the company among the top 20% of North American and Bermuda insurers Our approach to risk management is to identify all known and emerging risks that could have an impact on overall capital levels and financial results Regarding the potential effects of catastrophe losses, we closely monitor our catastrophe risk accumulations around the world  At the board level, the Nominating & Governance Committee charter has been amended to incorporate provisions for review of environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues, including climate change 

Because the potential physical effects of climate change present a significant risk to the company, they have been integrated into Chubbs overall risk management process Through the use of catastrophe models, Chubb manages severe weather risk to indirect client exposures throughout the world Special emphasis is given to areas where Chubb has significant exposures and the inherent risk from extreme weather events  such as tropical cyclone and other windstorm  is deemed to be high, such as the coastal United States, Southeast Asia and UK/Europe 

We mitigate our exposure to climate change risk by actively hedging catastrophe risk in both the reinsurance and capital markets In addition, our investment portfolio, which backs the risks assumed through our insurance business, is highly diversified by risk, industry, location and type and duration of security Successful risk transfer from policyholders to insurance and capital markets also requires industry standards around exposure data We are committed to helping the industry improve standards that will ultimately help increase risk transfer capacity and provide additional incentive for risk mitigation behavior by policyholders

Chubbs process also accounts for the potential impact of catastrophe and climate risks on the companys own facilities and operations Although minimal, direct risk to Chubbs business operations exists if such weather events occur in places where Chubb has offices Chubb has developed a Business Continuity Management Program, which has been tested during severe weather events, and Chubbs operations have functioned effectively",7

Bankers recognizes that climate change is expected to alter hurricane frequency and severity, a risk to which Bankers is most exposed  As a result, Bankers is concerned about hurricane exposures, and reviews its risk of exposure with catastrophe models that use the latest interpretations of climate and weather data to create the most up-to-date view of predicted hurricane activity  Bankers reinsurance strategy involves using modeled loss distributions to purchase reinsurance to meet rating agency expectations and reduce risk to internal thresholds  Consequently, Bankers structure reflects the most recent information about hurricane activity, including information related to climate change as viewed by the model vendors  Although there is a long timescale to climate change, Bankers has employed an annual evaluation of risk and management strategy, which enables Bankers to account for impacts of climate change as those impacts become known  As a result, Bankers is able to regularly review Capital liquidity and potential surplus impacts based on these types of events",2

Kaiser Foundation Health Plan," SASB also noted that an increase in the frequency of extreme weather events has the potential to impact costs and liabilities by generating additional covered medical expenses and that the associated risks could lead to an increased cost of capital Higher incidence of disease could negatively affect both clinical and non-clinical staff availability, resulting in higher expenditures on sick leave and backfilling The financial implications of these health-related impacts are difficult to quantify Changes in physical climate may also affect the efficiency of our facility operations, including increased power and water consumption necessary to maintain the indoor environment of our hospitals and patient care buildings
According to the US Global Change Research Programs published 2016 scientific assessment of the impacts of climate change on human health in the United States:
Current and future climate impacts expose more people in more places to public health threats Already in the United States, we have observed climate-related increases in our exposure to elevated temperatures; more frequent, severe, or longer-lasting extreme events; degraded air quality; diseases transmitted through food, water, and disease vectors (such as ticks and mosquitoes); and stresses to our mental health and well-being Almost all of these threats are expected to worsen with continued climate change Some of these health threats will occur over longer time periods, or at unprecedented times of the year; some people will be exposed to threats not previously experienced in their locations Overall, instances of potentially beneficial health impacts of climate change are limited in number and pertain to specific regions or populations For example, the reduction in cold-related deaths is projected to be smaller than the increase in heat-related deaths in most regions Every American is vulnerable to the health impacts associated with climate change Increased exposure to multiple health threats, together with changes in sensitivity and the ability to adapt to those threats, increases a persons vulnerability to climate-related health effects The impacts of climate change on human health interact with underlying health, demographic, and socioeconomic factors Through the combined influence of these factors, climate change exacerbates some existing health threats and creates new public health challenges While all Americans are at risk, some populations are disproportionately vulnerable, including those with low income, some communities of color, immigrant groups (including those with limited English proficiency), Indigenous peoples, children and pregnant women, older adults, vulnerable occupational groups, persons with disabilities, and persons with preexisting or chronic medical conditions 
In the April 4, 2013 edition of the New England Journal of Medicine, McMichael identifies three categories of climate-change risks to health, along with their causal pathway:
1	Primary: Direct biologic consequences of heat waves, extreme weather events, and temperature-enhanced levels of urban air pollutants;
2	Secondary: Risks mediated by changes in biophysically and ecologically based processes and systems, particularly food yields, water flows, infectious-disease vectors, and (for zoonotic diseases) intermediate-host ecology; and
3	Tertiary: More diffuse effects (eg, mental health problems in failing farm communities, displaced groups, disadvantaged indigenous and minority ethnic groups); consequences of tension and conflict owing to climate changerelated declines in basic resources (water, food, timber, living space)
With regard to primary risks, climate change directly impacts the populations in all geographical areas that KP serves While all regions in which KP operates are at risk of illnesses and loss of life due to extreme temperatures, the specific risk exposures may vary For example, while the Northern and Southern California regions are particularly affected by droughts, wildfires and heat waves, the Mid-Atlantic States and Georgia are more prone to severe storms and storm surges Hawaii and the Pacific Northwest are relatively more exposed to coastal flooding as well as heat waves In general, global warming can aggravate the effects of pre-existing health conditions such as chronic respiratory disease and asthma, due to increases in air pollutants and aeroallergens There is evidence of declining air quality in cities since greater heat can also worsen air pollution such as ground-level ozone or smog According to the National Center for Health Statistics, overall current asthma prevalence among adults increased from 20012002 (71%) to 20132014 (92%) By weight status, prevalence increased among overweight adults but not among adults in the obese or normal weight categories 
With regard to secondary risks, climate-related disturbances in ecological systems, such as changes in the range of infective parasites, can increase the incidence of serious infectious diseases The tick that carries Lyme Disease is reported in 457% of US counties, up from 30% in 1998  Other secondary health effects of global warming include water- and food-borne diseases Warm temperatures also increase water pollution which harms human health In rural areas, increased food insecurity can occur due to geographical shifts in optimum growing conditions and decreases in crop yields; reduced water resources for agriculture and for human consumption; and loss of property such as cropland because of floods, droughts and a rise in sea level
With regard to tertiary risks, according to The Medical Society Consortium on Climate and Health: Many people exposed to the worst extreme weather events experience stress and serious mental health consequences including depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and increases in suicidal thoughts and behavior Such disasters are also associated with increases in alcohol or drug abuse Children may also experience prolonged separation from their parents Beyond the well-known risks specific disasters pose to our mental health, the physical, social, and economic stresses created by climate change all increase our risk of mental health problems

Swiss Re follows a holistic, consistent, and economically sound approach to the inclusion of ESG considerations throughout the investment process, as well as active ownership
practices Swiss Re is convinced that this is a prerequisite for sustainable value creation

At the end of 2013, approximately 35% of our investment portfolio was managed by
external asset managers These portfolios (equity and selected credit portfolios) are
screened on an annual basis by a leading expert in ESG-related company services This
expert provides in-depth research, ratings and analysis of the environmental, social and
governance-related business practices They assess our portfolios relative to traditional as well as tailored ESG benchmarks built up on the following criteria:

-Environmental: Climate Change, Natural Resources Use, Waste Management and Environmental Opportunities;
-Social: Human Capital, Product Safety, Social Opportunities; 
-Governance: Corporate Governance, Business Ethics, Government & Public Policy

In addition, we take into account environmental factors within our internal Sustainability
Risk Rating which measures the overall social, environmental and human rights situation in
a country This rating measure is used to assess our Sovereign Fixed Income portfolio
(government bonds) By the end of 2013, 32% of our investment portfolio was invested in
Sovereign Fixed Income 

We systematically review the potential significance of environmental issues and investigate them accordingly Swiss Re employs a scoring methodology for each country, developed by the internal Sustainability and Political Risk Management team The scoring methodology uses data from sources such as Global Peace Index, World Bank data, Transparency International, World Economic Forum, Yale University and Freedomhouse The outcome of this analysis is widely distributed and used across the Group and all investment professionals have access to the information The ESG ratings on a country level are updated and distributed on a quarterly basis, or more frequently when required

In Swiss Re's direct real estate investments, sustainability criteria play an essential role The Energy Mission Statement describes strict sustainability guidelines for investment as well as own used properties It sets the standards for new constructions as well as refurbishments - ie MINERGIE standard, (wwwminergiech), a Swiss quality label
specifying high levels of energy efficiency and superior user comfort

As a re-/insurer, Swiss Re is a long-term investor Therefore it is important that we also take a long-term view on the risk factors that may have an adverse impact on our portfolio, which would include climate change Swiss Re is committed to act as an advocate of long-term investments in infrastructure, as reflected under the joint publication by Swiss Re and the Institute of International Finance See ""Infrastructure investing It matters"": http://mediaswissrecom/documents/Infrastructure_Investment_IIFpdf

A major component of the Companys ERM program is management of natural catastrophe risk from events such as hurricanes, earthquakes, severe thunderstorms, tornadoes, hail, floods, wildfires, drought, and other natural catastrophes The Company closely monitors changes to the frequency and severity of weather-related natural catastrophes, as well as changing demographic patterns (eg, coastal migration) which could increase potential exposure to climate risk Liberty Mutual rigorously manages its natural catastrophe exposures through its ERM program, utilizing the latest loss simulation models from catastrophe modeling firms AIR Worldwide and Risk Management Solutions As part of its natural catastrophe modeling and exposure management, Liberty Mutual incorporates the most up to date scientific advances in the estimation of the Companys natural catastrophe loss exposure 

A vital function of ERM is establishing exposure and loss thresholds for natural catastrophe events and ensuring the amount of capital at risk does not exceed these thresholds By using both the loss simulation models, as well as historical loss trend data, Liberty Mutual can estimate losses for natural catastrophe events of various magnitudes and probabilities This information is incorporated into strategic planning, pricing, and reinsurance purchasing decisions Reinsurance products, which include traditional reinsurance, sidecars, and other risk transfer mechanisms, are used to ensure that the Companys net losses (and capital at risk) associated with significant natural catastrophe events does not exceed established thresholds

Liberty Mutual has a catastrophe modeling Research and Development (R&D) team that is tasked with identifying opportunities to improve the accuracy of catastrophe modeling tools utilized by the Company for natural catastrophe exposure management This is accomplished by using new scientific research, tools, and technologies to both modify third party models and create internally developed models With regard to climate change, the R&D team has historically focused on models for hurricanes and severe convective storms, which comprise the majority of the Companys natural catastrophe exposure The R&D team continues to evaluate the credibility of new modeling methodology for perils, such as wildfire, as they become available All model methodologies are rigorously back tested against prior event losses, with the goal of improving the predictive capabilities of the models for Liberty Mutuals own portfolio of exposures

When evaluating the potential financial impact of losses related to hurricane exposures, Liberty Mutual reviews the warm sea surface temperature (WSST) event catalog alongside the standard long-term historical catalog This WSST event catalog incorporates the estimated increase in frequency and severity of hurricanes in response to sea surface temperatures that are higher than the long-term historical average Another vital component of the Liberty Mutuals ERM program is its Emerging Risks Committee, which conducts evaluations of risks that are difficult to quantify, continuing to evolve and could have a material impact Liability risks related to climate change are one of the key emerging risks monitored by this Committee

ENCOURAGING ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSIBILITY
(GRI: 414-417; DJSI: 252, FTSE4Good)
As a global company MAPFREs environmental commitment is also focused on promoting environmental responsibility among employees, suppliers, customers and business managers, public and private associations and organisations and other stakeholders connected to MAPFREs activity, involving them in the achievement of goals, developing awareness actions and good practices, contributing to the development and dissemination of scientific knowledge and participating in environmental forums
Public bodies and authorities
MAPFRE participates in the main sustainability forums, such as the United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative (UNEP FI) and the Global Compact It is also very active in other forums, such as the National Congress of the Environment (CONAMA) and participates in conferences and working groups related to the analysis and evaluation of environmental risks, climate change and greenhouse gases MAPFRE also participates in initiatives designed to raise the publics awareness of the challenges posed by sustainable development and the risks associated with climate change
An example of this has been the participation, for the fourth year, in Earth Hour, in which the MAPFRE companies in Brazil, Mexico, Puerto Rico, Argentina, Colombia and Spain have taken part In addition to participating in this initiative with the symbolic gesture of turning off the company's neon signs and its advertising billboard lights for one hour in 34 main buildings and 204 commercial offices, employees have been encouraged through the Corporate Portal to take part from their homes
The Group also backs global environmental programmes such as the Carbon Disclosure Project, of which MAPFRE is a signatory, and in whose 2012 ""Iberia 125"" report it has advanced 11 points to an 83 disclosure score, and a C-band performance score
A broad range of measures has been adopted in Brazil and Puerto Rico (the companies there are implementing the Corporate Environmental Strategic Plan), with many more planned in the short term in these two countries and the United States
Suppliers
As established by the Principles for Sustainable Insurance, Environmental Responsibility is propagated in the value chain MAPFRE contributes to its suppliers' environmental performance by establishing selection criteria that assess their environmental conduct, and by ensuring that environmental clauses feature systematically in contracts Environmental clauses in bidding specifications help to foster sustainability in suppliers, as do sustainability criteria in procurement specifications and in the matrices used for comparing tenders, with particular attention to large corporate supplies 
In addition, it issues guidelines to suppliers of businesses or services that impact the environment and operate in environmentally certified work centres with a view to informing them of best practice in their business lines
Compliance with these measures is audited by MAPFREs in-house audit department
Meanwhile, MAPFREs Environmental Services suppliers form part of a constant evaluation process that guarantees the continuity of their authorizations and their service capacity

As discussed in response to Question #2, State Farm does not specifically link the increase or decrease in frequency or severity of weather events to specific measures of climate as several different factors can affect our insurance business  All increases or decreases in severity and frequency of weather events that impact insured perils have a potential to affect the insurance business  However, that impact from climate change risk is heightened or reduced depending on an insurers freedom to react to the risk exposure This results in the same risk exposure potentially impacting an insurer differently in different geographical areas  Therefore articulating geographical areas affected by these risks and where action has been taken solely because of climate change risk could create inaccurate impressions of how climate change risk affects a particular geographical area versus the other issues in that geographical area that impacts an insurer

Farmers Insurance Company of Washington,"  Regulatory risks as diverse as insurance regulatory obligations, emissions caps, base load management requirements, and building code requirements could impact the insurance business  Regulation, as well, can have the unintended consequence of masking risk based price signals and could cause stakeholders to increase climate related risk  rather than manage and reduce such risks  For example, subsidizing property insurance premiums, or flood insurance premiums or providing insurance or agreements to re-build in regularly eroded coastal locations or high risk fire areas could cause increase of building in such locations in a manner economically inconsistent with the physical risks presented by climate change

Regulatory uncertainty and regulation that is not economically well-grounded can create additional risk for both insurers and society  Even where public policies are well grounded in sound economic policy, multi-state and nationally active insurers will likely be required to address potentially disparate and conflicting climate policies and rules and bear the associated costs 

These generally complex issues involving the interplay of new requirements within existing legal structures create unique risks; results of the same public policy will likely be different when applied in different jurisdictions - unless the results of interplay are completely and accurately analyzed in the development of such policy

Potential unintended negative consequences of regulatory action could pose a challenge for the industry, such as where the true economic cost of new legislation has not been well thought through or where the new legislation results in a disproportionate allocation of costs of climate related risk  In addition, competing requirements could mean that compliance in one jurisdiction may not satisfy other jurisdictions, thus creating duplicative or additive expenditures in the development of adaptive risk management solutions without demonstrable economic or social benefit  Additionally, regulatory actions may restrict a company from making needed changes to its pricing or prompt litigation which could put a financial strain on the organization

As the insurance industry faces regulatory risk, they face legal risk as well  Climate-related legislation that is not well-crafted may create incentives for lawsuits in some jurisdictions  Even in the absence of new laws, there have already been and may continue to be attempts to use existing laws to bring more climate change-related litigation against sovereign entities and companies in particular sectors 

With respect to an insurers own operations and physical facilities, regulatory initiatives relating to emissions limits, transportation, water and energy use could impact office planning, employee commuting patterns and general resource usage  Within Farmers, activities to help respond to these trends have begun, including telecommuting, meetings held via phone, video and webinar, recycling and other environmentally-friendly practices

Farmers also has exposure to physical risks of climate change with respect to its own operations and as a result of exposures of its insureds assumed by Farmers though insurance policies  As outlined in the previous section, the physical risks impacting Farmers customers, as a result of climate change, may generate higher volatility in claims

A growing consensus among climate change experts suggests that changing weather patterns present risks of concern related to climate change  Direct impacts such as increased frequency and severity of precipitation events, droughts, wildfire are among the multiplicity of potential conditions that could impact ultimate loss events for insureds  The risk of these events could also pose a financial strain on the organization  Improved resilience and customers risk management actions continue to be significant foci of Farmers  The potential indirect physical and public health impact, such as increased frequency of widespread disease events and localized food and water shortages, may also affect many areas of property and casualty insurance  Such physical risks have both obvious and subtle consequences for insurers  These vulnerabilities, risks, and consequences are considered as an integrated part of the underwriting process in a manner appropriate given the tenor of the insurance instrument and the manifestation of variability, risk management vulnerability reductions and impacts

With regard to the insurers' own operations or investments, insurers, like their customers, have facilities and operations that are exposed to physical risks of climate change described above  Climate change (severe drought) may drive people/employees away from California, which could be damaging to a Southern California based company

To achieve this goal, we invest steadily in energy-efficient lighting, HVAC systems and share best practices from successful facilities with other facility managers on a regular basis We have upgraded or installed building automation systems that allow shut down of air conditioning and lighting during off hours Since 2009, weve cut our energy consumption by 47 million kilowatt hours (kWh) and in doing so saved more than $16 million Our efforts to reduce energy consumption has cut our carbon dioxide emissions by nearly 40,000 tons since 2009, which is the equivalent of consuming four million gallons of gasoline or burning more than 39 million tons of coal This equates to 12 months of electricity for 4,000 homes

In 2017, Assurants global facilities footprint consisted of 3,060,304 square feet of corporate real estate, including 1,743,560 square feet of owned space Approximately 90 percent of our total corporate real estate is in the United States Our Office of Corporate Facilities Management tracks the energy consumption and emissions at nine Assurant-owned facilities along with several fully leased locations using ENERGY STARs Portfolio Manager This tool also generates an ENERGY STAR score, which compares a buildings energy consumption to similar buildings nationwide Buildings that score above the 75th percentile are eligible to receive ENERGY STAR certificationan annual application that a licensed Professional Engineer or Registered Architect must verify In 2017, Assurant operated 11 ENERGY STAR certified buildings, approximately 73 percent of the total square footage of our internally managed facilities

NATIONWIDE PROP & CAS INS CO,"S Nationwide and its subsidiaries write personal, agribusiness, commercial property casualty insurance, as well as life insurance and retirement solution products Nationwide stays abreast of the most recent scientific studies and findings with regard to climate change Currently, the consensus opinion by the scientific community on observed trends is that tropical cyclones, extropical cyclones (winter storms), and severe thunderstorms will increase in intensity while decreasing in frequency due to climate change Wildfires and floods are expected to increase in both intensity and frequency

Nationwide faces several potential business risks associated with climate change including:

	Potential volatility in results due to possible increased frequency and/or severity of weather-related catastrophic losses;
	Regulatory constraints on charging appropriate rates that take into account possible weather changes and related losses that are not reflected by historical statistics; 
	Market share of business being adversely impacted due to a disproportionate growth of population and property along coastal areas; 
	Catastrophic losses not limited to coastal areas potentially becoming more frequent (as in hurricane-related losses in the Midwest);
	Disparate impact of climate change on certain insured segments either directly (such as agriculture), or through regulation (eg heavy industry due to emissions) These insured segments could be significantly impacted which could in turn affect the companys business and
	Availability and cost of risk transfer options (Reinsurance, Cat Bonds, Cat Swaps, etc)
As we go to market with different initiatives, geographic diversification is one of the factors taken into consideration Additionally, Nationwide maintains sizable investment portfolios which might be impacted by climate change Therefore, consideration is given to the potential impacts of climate change on the investment portfolio 

As many of these risks cross boundaries, the risk assessment needs to consider the correlation of the risk across the entire enterprise

Associations play an instrumental role in disseminating the importance of sustainability and transparency to organizations worldwide By sharing guidance, best practices and information with their members, and even by engaging in the development of reporting rules, associations are helping make a difference to the sustainability performance of thousands of companies  Association members help the trade associations to identify innovative approaches they and their members could adopt to face the worlds current sustainability challenges From new ways of approaching income creation to protecting the worlds resources and educating the next generation of business leaders, associations can inspire their members to move the sustainability agenda forward Boards are increasingly being challenged on a range of sustainability related topics and the collaboration between trade organizations about the benefits of integrating sustainability into core business activities, as well as reporting on performance to the markets is an integral step in the process
	Organizations work with associations to reach all companies in the world and encourage them to be transparent about their sustainability performance By doing so, they can increase the value they offer their members, helping their organizations navigate todays sustainability challenges In addition, active associations can be at the forefront of CC legislation and the development process of reporting and sustainability integration

Unum leverages trade associations for sustainability best practices, staying abreast of the latest research, and methods to align our facilities to have a lesser impact on CC Because we are interested in minimizing climate change and continually evolving sustainable practices, we participate in various activities that may influence policy They are, but not limited to, the following:
	Participation in association roundtable discussions
	Partnership/networking with other organizations and leaders to share knowledge and best practices
	Benchmarking analytics to ensure sustainability alignment with like organizations
	Research tools and resources to ensure we are knowledgeable on the latest CC research, products, services, and literature

Kaiser Foundation Plan of Washington," The ERM program is governed by executive management and the Board of Directors The program has a strategic and multi-year (three-year) lens It deals with risks and opportunities that can affect value creation and preservation over time, and provides a holistic view of risks, including external, operational, and strategic Climate change is included as a key aspect of the ""trends impacting health"" risk 
With regard to managing health risks correlated with climate change, KP is uniquely positioned to 1) have early indications regarding weather/climate-related conditions through its research programs, and 2) provide timely and responsive care to members through its integrated care delivery system In terms of facility risks, KP has a robust business continuity program that ensures continued operations in the event of natural or manmade disasters
 KPs executive leadership has adopted an organizational guideline related to climate change, excerpted below:
If greenhouse gas emissions continue to increase, climate change will cause health effects that will directly impact KPs ability to fulfill our promise of quality affordable care Global climate instability will increase the demand for health care The costs of energy and water are likely to increase while supplies are diminished Threats to biodiversity could also threaten the availability of potential cures for diseases KP adopts the following principles:
1	Understand climate change
2	Assess and avoid climate-related impacts
3	Commit to continuous improvement
4	Support industry standards
5	Inform public policies

As noted in KPs response to question 1, KP has a goal to become carbon neutral in 2020, and one way that KP reduces its avoidable emissions is through large-scale investments in clean and renewable energy sources An added benefit of these investments is that, by providing KP with a long-term fixed price for electricity, they provide KP with an important hedge against potentially significant swings in energy prices resulting from climate impacts and/or climate policies

Risk identification and assessment activities take place as part of our ERM program  Part of this process includes an evaluation of the likelihood, financial impact, and onset of each risk and accompanying scenarios  Beyond our formal ERM program, our catastrophe management area conducts more thorough ongoing analysis of weather-related hazards and collaborates with other functional areas to formulate our view of risk and to develop strategies to mitigate risks

In responding, State Farm has utilized the definition impact of climate change risk developed for the Financial Condition Examiners Handbook which is
the impact of climate change risk may be identified as any significant change in the measures of climate over an extended period of time that includes major changes in relative temperatures, precipitation, or wind patterns that occur over several decades or longer It may include the effects from the increase in severity and occurrence of climate change-related weather events (some may include but are not limited to: thunderstorms - including severe hail and strong winds; tornadoes; hurricanes; windstorms; the aftermath of floods; heat waves; droughts; rise in sea-level; forest fires; grass fires and the resultant subsequent debilitating effects created by these events)
Although State Farm does not specifically differentiate any increase or decrease in severity and occurrence of weather events to specific measures of climate, State Farm continuously measures and models risk for the perils insured under its contracts to determine its total risk exposure including those related to weather events Over the period from 1980- 2013, non-hurricane catastrophe losses have been increasing by an average of 26%, with three of the five largest catastrophe years within the last six years This trend is the result of several factors such as population concentration, population shift to the south, land use, as well as, changes to weather patterns related to climate change
The structure for such activities with respect to climate change risk is through various units of the company(s) handling separate general functions, such as underwriting and actuarial, and the information developed is reported through Enterprise Risk Management process   Within the functions there are several individuals and teams responsible for identifying and monitoring the potential risk and creating strategies to mitigate and manage such risk to financially sound levels

Kaiser Foundation Health Plan,"
One way that KP may be able to regularly reassess climate change related risks over time is through health research carried out by the organization Two current research activities of note are:
1	Kaiser Permanentes Division of Research initiated a project, with funding from the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, titled Climate Change and Health: Assessing the Risk of Preterm Delivery The aims of the project are to: 1) examine the association between temperature during the warm season and risk of PTD, and 2) assess the above relationships by maternal factors including maternal age race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status in women who delivered in Kaiser Permanente Northern California hospitals between 1995 and 2009
2	In 2005, Kaiser Permanente launched a program aimed at building one of the largest and most comprehensive resources in the United States for research on the influence of both inherited and environmental factors on peoples health The databank created through this program, now called the Kaiser Permanente Research Bank, has the ambitious goal of recruiting 500,000 Kaiser Permanente adult members to share health information and a small blood sample for research As of April 2017, the Research Bank is halfway toward its goal The Research Bank is already paying dividends in scientific studies that are examining the role of genes and environment in conditions as varied as diabetes, cancer, bipolar disorder, heart disease, asthma, glaucoma, multiple sclerosis, and migraine  among many others DNA samples are used to produce genotypic markers on the whole genomes of Research Bank participants, making it possible to study the role of genes in many different diseases and conditions As of April 2017, 100 research projects have been approved to use data from the Research Bank, and 32 studies have been published, including 3 in the prestigious journal Nature Genetics With 19 studies published in 2016, the pace is accelerating KP investigators and collaborating scientists can conduct research to understand genetic and environmental influences  including weather and climate influences  on disease susceptibility, the course of disease, and response to treatment; as well as to translate these findings into improvements in medical care and public health By studying data pulled from Kaiser Permanente Research Bank participants' health surveys, electronic health records and DNA samples, researchers are now looking for new ways to diagnose, treat and prevent certain diseases

Seaworthy Insurance Company,"  The Group includes several large subgroups of companies as well as a number of smaller subgroups and companies that operate independently While some of the larger subgroups own their own buildings and can thus have maximum control of their physical operations, many of the companies lease or rent the properties in which they operate, and therefore have less control of the physical aspects of their operations

Recycling of paper, glass and plastic are encouraged in all operations Reductions in energy usage are effected through the use of technology by encouraging electronic communication verses paper usage whenever available Imaging technology is used to replace paper usage and long term information storage Updating computer equipment regularly allows the Group to take advantage of newer technology, often reducing energy usage as well as adding more computing power while using less equipment Intelligent usage of energy is encouraged in all operations as a cost control issue as well as the positive impact that has for reducing the operational energy footprints

The two largest operational subgroups are General Reinsurance and GEICO  General Reinsurance has recently relocated its corporate headquarters in Stamford, CT, moving from an energy inefficient office environment, to an open floor design (no associates have offices, from the CEO on down) and specialized glass exterior that are energy efficient and result in cost savings to the company   

GEICO has the largest number of employees and physical operations among the Berkshire Hathaway group of insurance companies The following is GEICOs summary of their response to this question It serves as a model for its affiliates

GEICO is making significant strides in its Green initiatives, which includes measures to limit its greenhouse gas emissions The company has established green teams to focus on the issues and establish improvements The company encourages its associates to carpool, bike, or use public transportation, and it provides certain benefits to reduce the cost for its employees to use public transportation The company has increased its use of teleconferencing to reduce travel 

Here are several examples of changes implemented as a result of the green team efforts:

In GEICOs corporate headquarters it has eliminated all small departmental pantries and combined them into centralized pantries located strategically throughout the 600Ksf facility using strictly Energy Star approved appliances  More than 300 toasters were eliminated as well as toaster ovens, microwaves, portable and large refrigerators  The drastic reduction of appliances within the facility resulted in significant annual energy usage savings 

In a $2M+ project implemented in one of its regions, GEICO converted parking lot lighting from 400w metal halide to 255w LED  This region also switched from 32w T8 lamps to 25w T8 lamps on the production floors  100w metal halide lamps have been replaced by 20w LED in the stairwells

In an effort to reduce lighting to no more than the industry lighting levels GEICO removed lamps from 2x4 parabolic and other type of multi-lamp light fixtures where appropriate to conserve energy 

Many GEICO departments have implemented 2 sided printing versus printing on a single side of paper

One regional office installed a paper shredder in the vicinity of their loading dock to do its own shredding and bailing of paper

One regional office has solicited an energy consultant and the review and resulting changes implemented has resulted in significant electricity and natural gas usage savings 

GEICO has increased the number of four cylinder vehicles in its Corporate Fleet from 68% to 71% This has contributed to a corresponding decrease in the Running Expense for fuel to 997% below the industry average ($27149 GEICO vs $30157 Industry)  Furthermore, the average number of gallons of gasoline purchased has been reduced by 368% and the CO2 emissions have been reduced by 638%

The use of non-volatile organic ingredients paint is preferred wherever possible within its facilities

GEICO is implementing water saving measures at its corporate headquarters by remodeling restrooms with water saving faucets, 16 gal flush toilets and 125 gal flush urinals  The faucets have preset temperature controls as well  Green biodegradable restroom paper products are being used in some offices

GEICO also promotes the use of technology to its customer base to reduce the amount of paper mail it sends It encourages its customers to transact business and receive information from the company via email and the internet, which reduces the paper footprint impact on the environment

The core of GEICOs green efforts are the establishment of both a Recycling Program and an Energy Report Card Furthermore, GEICO has made strides in reducing the impact that its Fleet has on the environment The Recycling Program is aimed at reducing the waste generation at all GEICO facilities, including proper disposal of all recyclable materials such as paper, aluminum cans and plastic bottles, ink toner cartridges, electronic waste, fluorescent bulbs, construction waste and rechargeable batteries GEICO further reduces its paper usage by double sided printing on all photocopiers and network printers

There are hundreds of office supply products that are made from recycled materials that GEICO procures and stocks for the entire company from a national supplier The frequency by which recycled material office supplies is used depends on the product being ordered

The Energy Report Card is aimed at administering best practices at all GEICO facilities to reduce energy consumption To conserve energy, it has implemented:

The use of a heat exchanger that takes advantage of free cooling in temperatures of 55 degrees Fahrenheit or less during the year

Installation of contemporary 2 megawatt emergency backup power generators equipped with the most advanced low NOX emissions equipment

Reduced demand for cooling power in data centers by both alternating the operation of redundant AC units and proactively sealing cable cutout holes that can save appreciably on the energy consumed for data center equipment asset cooling  A further measure to reduce energy consumption was to raise thermostat set points such that AC units runs less often while at the same time providing suitable cooling for the intended space

Installation of lighting controllers which permit powering down entire floors of facilities lighting during non-business hours

	Removing excess light bulbs in workspaces based upon National Illumination Society lighting standards

 Replacing CRT computer monitors with flat screen monitor technology

Personal computers themselves are set to shut themselves off after a period of non-use (at night)

Copiers and printers are programmed to take advantage of sleep-mode inherent to the device when not in use

Deployment of new energy-wise vending machines

First Specialty Insurance Corporation," A central pillar of the strategy is to reduce its carbon footprint In 2003, Swiss Re became the first major financial player to commit to going carbon neutral

Our strategy to tackle climate change rests on four pillars, one of which is our pledge to reduce our own CO2 emissions Our Greenhouse Neutral Program has been the principal initiative to achieve this goal Originally launched in 2003 for a ten-year period, it combined two commitments:  firstly, to reduce our CO2 emissions per employee (full-time equivalent or FTE) by a specified  amount;  secondly, to fully offset all the remaining emissions by purchasing high-quality emission reduction credits, thus making the company greenhouse neutral for the whole period between 2003 and 2013 Over the course of the ten years, we gradually raised our reduction target from 15% to 45% per employee By the end of the programs first cycle in 2013, we had achieved a total reduction in CO2 emissions per employee of 493% compared to the base year 2003 Our new target is to keep our CO2 emissions per employee stable at the level of 2013 In view of our expansive business strategy, especially in high growth markets, we consider this to be an ambitious goal 

For the programs second cycle, we also extended the scope of our emissions reporting and of our offsetting commitment In addition to our Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions (heating and power consumption) and a major source of Scope 3 emissions (business travel), our reporting now covers further activities along our supply chain (Scope 3): employee commuting, copy paper use, waste generation, water use and technical gases Based on this, we extended our commitment to offset the CO2 emissions we cannot avoid to paper, waste, water and technical gases After a slight increase in 2014, total CO2 emissions per employee (FTE) decreased by 43% during 2015, mainly driven by a further reduction in the energy intensity of our offices and decreases in the emissions from commuting and business travel The latter was due to the fact that our employees made fewer business trips in carbon-intense flight classes, even though the total distance they travelled increased slightly on average Compared with 2013, our CO2 emissions per employee were 32% lower in 2015

Swiss Re has implemented a number of projects that reduce our environmental footprint:
	First, whenever possible, we purchase power from renewable sources This has been a key measure of our Greenhouse Neutral Program After starting to use renewable power at four European locations in 2005, we set ourselves the goal of using 100% renewable power at all locations where it is available in reliable and trustworthy quality by the end of 2013 Based on our quality assessments of available energy sources, we believe we reached this goal and used 100% renewable power at 25 locations in Asia, Europe, North America and Oceania as per the end of 2013 We are committed to source 100% of our energy needs from renewable sources at all our locations This is challenging because in a number of countries, there is a lack of renewable energy supplies This is why we helped to establish the Climate Groups RE100 initiative in 2014 as a founding member The goal of this initiative is to unite 100 of the worlds largest companies in a shared commitment to use 100% renewable power by 2020 To achieve this, the group approaches policymakers and regulators at national and sub-national level to increase renewable energy availability RE100 grew substantially in 2015 and now includes some of the worlds largest companies
	Second, we have made continuous efforts to lower the actual amount of energy consumed per employee, ie to reduce our energy intensity In the first phase of our Greenhouse Neutral Program, we set ourselves a 20% reduction target compared with 2003 levels, measured in kWh per employee Through many small measures to improve energy efficiency and by concentrating backoffice tasks in fewer and more energy-efficient buildings, we actually achieved a reduction of 465% by 2013 For the second phase of our Greenhouse Neutral Program (base year 2013), our commitment is to continuously reduce energy intensity by 2% per year We have exceeded that commitment, in the first two years of the program  our energy intensity was 165% lower at the end of 2015 than in 2013 
	Third, we continuously monitor all travel budgets and collect travel data centrally  Business travel easily constitutes Swiss Res largest emissions source today We have taken several measures to reduce the need for business travel and to curb unnecessary business trips, including increased use of videoconferencing services  
	Fourth, we have taken a number of measures to reduce waste internally  We have reduced the average amount of paper used by our employees in recent years by increasing access to scanning services While it is difficult for us to influence water use and waste generation at locations where we rent office space, we ensure appliances meet high standards of water efficiency in the office buildings we own Where possible, we strive to have waste-free office locations  For example, the Overland Park, KS, office is engaged in a pilot program to go waste-free and has not sent materials to a landfill for more than a year  
	Fifth, the second commitment of our Greenhouse Neutral Program is to compensate all CO2 emissions we cannot avoid For the seven emissions sources covered in the second phase of our Greenhouse Neutral Program, we bought and retired VERs for a total of 70,600 tons of CO2-eq in 2015 We are keen to ensure that the VERs we buy are of a high environmental standard Therefore, we have developed a set of criteria to select projects that generate certificates In particular, we give priority to those that create strong social side-effects and benefit the poorest regions

Combined Life Insurance of NY," Our analysis of the impact of various risks ranges from the known, based on definitive historical loss experience, to the hypothetical, where we use a calculation called probable maximum loss (PML) that relies on modeling based on various assumptions Risks are evaluated at least annually at three governance levels, with the companys senior management actively engaged in each The companys Risk and Underwriting Committee, product boards and risk-related committees meet as frequently as monthly to evaluate specific risks and risk accumulations in ACEs business activities and investments, while the Board of Directors Risk and Finance Committee meets regularly with company management Regarding the potential effects of catastrophe losses, we continue to closely monitor our catastrophe risk accumulation around the world In addition, we use catastrophe modeling packages reliant upon meteorology and engineering assumptions to simulate and estimate hurricane losses 

Since the insurance products that we provide clients around the world may provide coverage for all of the risks noted, there are potential financial implications for ACE The extent of potential negative implications depends on whether the loss is covered by the policy's terms and conditions and whether the underlying assumptions modeled in determining the pricing of the policy adequately reflect the potential risk If the model used to price coverage proves faulty or doesn't anticipate the potential magnitude of these risks in the future, then losses paid could exceed premiums collected, causing the company to draw a higher amount from its loss reserve pool that is set aside to pay future claims Conversely, if actual loss experience is lower than anticipated, positive adjustments could be made to reserve levels, producing a financial gain for the company If losses are not covered by ACEs policies, or if the losses are within the assumptions used to price the coverage, then there would be no adverse financial implications for the ACE

Humana Insurance Company," If this were to happen, it could lead to increased incidences of chronic illnesses and in the type of clinical services Humana will need to offer its customers For example, ""The Impacts of Climate Change on Human Health in the United States: A Scientific Assessment"" published by the US Global Change Research Program notes that climate change is already resulting in significant public health impacts which will continue to worsen if greenhouse gas emissions are not addressed

If Humana did not prepare for changes in physical climate, it is possible that Humana could suffer a loss in market share due to lack of readiness as well as increased operational costs associated with more health-related claims being filed It is difficult to assess the financial impacts of these risks given the complexity of climate change and population health, however we do not currently anticipate substantial bottom line impacts

Climate change risks may also affect Humanas premium pricing, and therefore projected revenues associated with our services Pricing and revenues are sensitive to several factors that may be impacted by climate change, including catastrophes or extreme weather events including public health epidemics or severe weather (eg hurricanes) We continually review estimates of future payments relating to benefit claims costs for services incurred and make necessary adjustments to our reserves, including premium deficiency reserves where appropriate However, these estimates involve extensive judgment, and have considerable inherent variability that is sensitive to claim payment patterns and medical cost trends Senior level management will review pertinent information and have the ultimate authority to recommend changes in services offered and cost structures related to shifts in claims filed, or other company procedures in order to reduce impacts from these changes in customer claims and health trends related to changes in climate The results of our partner dialogues and regional trending will inform future decisions around services offered to mitigate these impacts

Risks driven by changes in regulation

The financial risks resulting from an increase in operational and capital costs due to climate change-related regulations are considered to have a low magnitude of impact because energy expenditures represent less than 01% of Humanas total $10,052 million operating costs in 2020 Though operating expense increases due to energy taxes and regulations would have a material impact on budgetary costs, the overall operational cost impact for the portfolio would be minimal

Humana's Enterprise Associate and Business Solutions team continuously evaluates short-term and long-term regulatory risks around energy and carbon A combination of forecasted energy costs due to general commodity price pressures, taxes and regulations or other impact is evaluated by the team to manage evolving financial exposure to energy prices To curb projected increases, the team works to budget for cost and environmental impact mitigation efforts such as energy efficiency projects to manage this risk This resulted in the formulation of an aggressive energy and carbon reduction target for the portfolio in efforts to manage operating costs and reduce Humana's environmental impacts

Risks driven by changes in physical climate parameters 

Increases in average temperature could result in more cooling degree days for Humana's data centers which could increase cooling loads at these and other locations

Any rise in average temperature that results in more cooling degree days throughout the year could increase cooling costs at Humana facilities, and in particular the company's data centers Leveraging assumptions from the US Climate Resilience Toolkit (July 2016), which provides a net energy cost increase from higher temperatures of 10-20%, Humana has estimated the cost implications of rising data center energy consumption due to an increase in cooling degree days The potential aggregate estimated cost increase from 2030-2035 is $820,000-$1,640,000, which is less than 02% of Humanas $10,052 million operating costs in 2020

Humana has worked with its equipment partners, done extensive modelling of air flow and cooling loads, and is implementing optimization strategies to minimize the cost of cooling and reduce the temperature differential required, while maintaining the reliability and performance of its data center equipment  For example, our IT and Facilities Management teams collaborated to install new building management systems (BMS) at the data centers These systems provide visibility into energy efficiency opportunities such as upgrades to lithium batteries and the addition of smart tiles to enhance the BMS system by monitoring air flows not just at the cabinet level, but also at the overall level We have installed the Tridium system in the Louisville Data Center and are strategically allocating capital funds to pursue projects at the Simpsonville Data Center As part of these efforts, in collaboration with Enterprise Associate and Business Solutions, IT, and our facilities management vendor, we have achieved Energy Star certification for both of our data centers

While Humana does not have a direct cost associated with managing cooling degree days, past and ongoing investment in data center energy efficiency mitigates the risk by reducing overall energy consumption For example, Humana continues to use modeling software and tools purchased prior to the reporting period to optimize air flow and cooling needs In 2020, an HVAC Economizer Project commenced at our Waterside building, which is planned to save approximately 3,025 MWh and 1,395 mtons CO2e for a total investment of $834,000 Funding came from the HUM Enterprise Associate and Business Solutions Facilities Management team capital budget and the Facilities Management vendor managed the work

Significant weather events could also negatively impact our business by disrupting regular operations and limiting accessibility for our employees as well as our customers Our Florida, Puerto Rico, and Texas operations in particular are located in areas that often experience severe storms As our data centers have disaster recovery methods in place to manage for risks unrelated to climate change, the estimated financial implications of this type of service disruption are considered to be low We relocated our recovery systems to Kentucky as a direct result of the lessons learned from Hurricane Maria, supporting our efforts to mitigate against hurricanes and other weather events, for which the financial implications are difficult to assess

To decrease the potential of business interruption due to a significant weather event, Humana's data centers maintain two separate power inputs, from different grids The centers also maintain a robust generator system that can provide power for 3-5 days before requiring re-fueling, while fuel service is contracted for a priority refill if requested Dual cooling systems are also in place Data center exterior walls were built to exceed ""tornado-level"" winds of over 100 mph, and both data centers are built on land not susceptible to flooding Humana maintains a secondary data center to support disaster recovery of technical systems In addition to our facility-specific management methods, Humana also has a robust work at home program, allowing staff to work remotely should there be an instance of reduced accessibility/pandemic or other issue that may be caused by climate-related events Our work at home program has been thoroughly tested during 2020 while staying steadfast in our commitment to the needs of our health plan customers and simplifying access to care, reducing financial barriers and addressing social determinants of health A dedicated tool to track events is used to manage our response and communications, providing us with a readily available resource to understand any lessons learned

The management methods described, including the data center specifications, our Business Continuity Program, and our work at home program, and are considered to be routine operations for Humana to manage for several risks and opportunities in addition to the potential effects of climate change

John Hancock Life Insurance Company Of New York,"  Below is a sample of the ways we have altered our investment strategy across various asset classes in response to analyzing the impacts of climate change:
Fixed income
Manulife manages a large, long-tenor, investment-grade fixed income debt portfolio to support our product guarantees in our life insurance policies and other products  As part of this investment program, we try to evaluate all risks to the performance of this portfolio over its life, including climate change

With respect to power and energy investments, we remain alert as to how climate risk is affecting power and energy companies over the long term  Our investor position as a senior lender to many of the diversified power and energy companies that will probably be most acutely affected gives us some investment protection from financial pressures that could emerge as these companies work to adapt to a lower carbon future

We have also altered our fixed income investment strategy to take advantage of the market opportunities presented by climate change and the environment For example, regulatory initiatives launched in certain jurisdictions in response to climate change mitigation and adaptation requirements have created programs and policies to encourage renewable energy projects  These government initiatives have created new opportunities for our project finance investment areas and as a result, our renewable power project financing has grown considerably over the past decade  Since 2002, Manulifes aggregate total investment in renewable power and energy efficiency projects exceeds C$109 billion

Private equity
Similar to our fixed income investments, we remain alert as to how climate risk is affecting power and energy companies over the long term and we monitor the changing operating landscape while capitalizing on new investment opportunities presented by changing regulation enticing the development of renewable energy  As an example, our subsidiary Regional Power which develops, owns and operates hydroelectric facilities in Canada, is now expanding into other types of renewable energy production because of expanded market opportunities as a result of regulatory changes

Natural resources investments
The investment strategy of our Hancock Natural Resource Group (HNRG) subsidiary, which invests in farms, timberland and renewable energy from biomass, gives consideration to the potential physical impacts of climate change  HNRG evaluates potential land holdings from a long-term investment perspective (ie 20+ years), and thus we have enhanced our due diligence and are looking to focus our acquisitions in geographies where water availability is conducive to value growth over several decades and other climate-influenced natural forces such as pests and fire do not militate against investment  In addition, the Hancock Renewable Energy Group (HREG) is pursuing acquisitions and investment in the waste and bio-energy sectors Investments include conversion facilities that utilize biomass from forest and agricultural lands and other waste streams HREG provides institutional investors with the opportunity to invest in carbon offset and low carbon impact projects  Since 2011, HREG has invested US$300 million in renewable energy projects

Real estate investments
Market demand for more sustainable buildings has altered our investment and capital improvement strategy in our real estate investments  We are increasingly looking to invest in LEED certified buildings and other types of sustainability certifications for our buildings (ie Energy Star or BOMABest ratings) and currently 41 per cent of our real estate portfolio is certified to a sustainability standard  Fluctuating electricity prices are driving a strategic focus on energy efficiency in our real estate operations and as such, energy efficiency improvement projects are an important component of operational and capital planning We set annual energy conservation targets for the real estate portfolio and we strive to achieve these targets through usage monitoring, building systems optimization and capital improvements

The American Family group of companies has an Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) function that provides risk reporting to the board of directors (BOD) at least 4 times a year In 2014 and annually since, the BOD approves the enterprise risk policy that explicitly describes the risk appetite and tolerance levels set by senior leadership of the enterprise The policy provides overarching guidance to ensure risk exposures will remain within acceptable boundaries The overarching guidance provided by the risk policy considers natural catastrophe risk Tolerances that align with the enterprise appetite have been established for this risk

In its role to evaluate risk to the enterprise, the BOD conducts sessions on risk topics, including on climate risk

To ensure the BOD and executive management receive information about emerging risks, the enterprise has a process in place to identify and assess all risks faced, including financial, operational, technology, regulatory/legal and strategic risks New and evolving risk identification is conducted in conjunction with strategic planning Risks identified can include those due to changes in processes, new strategies, or external factors such as the changes to the industry and the way we conduct business One of the risks is the impact of severe weather events While this risk is one that is continuously monitored in the organization, the ERM process considers changes to experience, computer models, and trends identified by experts through ERMs networking and involvement in professional organizations Exposures are evaluated in relation to capital quarterly to ensure the risk is within tolerance, and therefore, within the stated enterprise risk policy appetite and tolerance

American Familys investment managers take the issue of climate risk into consideration in the same manner as any other potential drivers of risk and return in the investment portfolio Investments are managed to ensure the organization can respond in the event of a natural catastrophe

Starmount LIfe Insurance Company,"  To summarize, they are:  
	Risks driven by changes in regulation
	Risks driven by changes in physical climate parameters
	Risks driven by changes in other climate-related developments

In our US operations, we have identified the following risks driven by changes in regulation:

Lack of regulation resulting in potential increased operational costs:  Future governmental emission programs either at the Federal, State or local level could impact our business Through trade organizations and other information sources, Unum keeps abreast of pending regulations that could impact our operations If a new regulation is implemented that impacts Unum, measures will be put into place to minimize the impact

1	Uncertainty surrounding new regulation resulting in potential increased capital costs:  As global transition to a low-carbon economy escalates, Unum will be required to comply with CC regulations as they are presented Compliance with regulations requires man-power and capital expenditure that would not have been required in absence of the regulation Unum Group owns four physical sites in four states, SC, ME, TN, and MA We operate these facilities utilizing green building best practices We are positioned to adopt new regulations when and if enacted Unum has a government relations department that stays abreast of federal and state issues relating to all topics, including climate change, and has positioned Unum to respond as regulations are being formulated and adopted

In our US operations, we have identified the following risks driven by physical climate parameters:
1	Change in mean (average) temperature resulting in potential increased operational costs:  This risk could cause an increased expense for utility consumption required for employee comfort in any of Unum's office buildings For example, in the Southeast, increases in temperatures caused by emissions will require additional cooling resulting in higher energy consumption to provide employee comfort while working Actions taken to address this potential risk include upgrade to our building systems to improve operational efficiency and lessen expenses

2	Other physical climate risk drivers which could potentially increase both capital and operational costs:  the CHA campus is subject to tornado and severe storm damage; and Portland and Worcester are subjected to winter weather Shifts in weather patterns has resulted in major weather events such as tornados and flooding that can result in major physical damage to infrastructure in any of our buildings For example, in 2011, our Chattanooga, TN campus narrowly escaped damage caused by one of the 27 tornadoes that touched down in the area The campus suffered minor damage from the storms but was not directly impacted

3	Uncertainty of physical risks which could potentially increase both capital and operational costs:  CC presents a plethora of weather-related risks as weather patterns become increasingly more severe and unpredictable These weather patterns present challenges as abnormal occurrences continue to materialize These uncertainties, including extremes in precipitation, droughts, increased snowfall and ice, rises in sea level, cyclones, etc are becoming more prevalent and require strategic planning, funding, and mitigation efforts

In our US operations, we have identified the following risks driven by other climate-related developments:
1	Reputation- which could potentially result in a reduced demand for our services:  Unum provides services to a large number of fortune 500 companies and receives inquiries from customers about our environmental programs and performance and also from State Commissioners Negative publicity may result in current and potential customers from conducting business with Unum

At the asset level, climate-related risks including physical impacts that may affect individual facilities (data centers, warehouses, retail locations, offices, distribution centers) are identified, assessed and captured as part of the Risk Assessment process These risks are monitored 24 hours a day, 7 days a week through our CVS Health Operations 
Center (CHOC) Staff in the CHOC are trained to monitor the current threat landscape utilizing a combination of open source data as well as leveraging Enterprise Risk Event Monitoring visualization software 

The process for identifying and assessing the potential size and scope of risks is assigned to BULs The process includes qualitative and quantitative analysis to assess the potential size and scope of identified risks based on the criticality, timeliness and relevance of the issue to CVS Health assets, operations and colleagues The potential number of short- or long-term site closures, colleagues that could be impacted, and impacts on revenue, operating costs, and physical assets are assessed Risks that may have a substantive financial impact are presented to the Enterprise Risk Committee, to further assess the potential size and scope of risk to the overall enterprise 

The process by which CVS Health determines the relative significance of climate-related risks in relation to other risks is as follows At the company level, CVS Health assesses all risks, to determine the likelihood of material losses to the business Risks are prioritized based on the financial, reputational, operational impacts to the Corporation based on the following criteria:
-The importance of the issue to and potential impact on CVS Health
-The importance of the issue to and potential impact on our stakeholders
-The amount of reasonable control CVS Health has over a particular issue

(Hereinafter referred to as the Companies)

Please note that the above list of companies have approximately 20% of their total writings in Property and the remaining 80% of their total writings are for lines other than property; thus the primary business focus is on liability lines of insurance   Additionally the companies write almost entirely commercial lines risks rather than personal lines risks 

Berkley Life and Health Insurance Company (Berkley Life) writes health insurance and reinsurance in four primary areas: medical stop loss, managed care, special risk and group captive  Historically we have not experienced any increase in losses as a result of natural catastrophes such as hurricane, flood or tornado, nor do we currently anticipate this to occur in the future  Neither the management of Berkley Life nor the Berkley Group Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) team has identified any link between loss frequency and / or severity in these niche health insurance products written by Berkley Life and natural catastrophes such as hurricane, tornado, flood, drought or wildfire  Consequently although Berkley Life has full access to the Berkley Groups research into the potential impact of climate change, it is not currently an issue for Berkley Life from an insured loss perspective 
Yes, Companies have a variety of campaigns to bring employee awareness to and participation in programs to reduce its carbon footprint through the following:  

	Recycling: Recycle paper, bottles and cans, Styrofoam, cardboards and plastics, ink cartridges, used computer equipment  Document destruction bins and a pick-up service shreds, and recycles the paper in those destruction bins so that trees are preserved within the environment Additionally Companies have designated collection bins for items such as eyeglasses, batteries, and old cell phones, and in turn, donate to organizations that are able to re-use the recycled items 

In an effort to convert to paperless as much as possible, existing paper files are imaged into electronic format and printer usage is monitored to build awareness amongst users Additionally, offices have procured printers that have the functionality to select the most effective print method automatically   Marketing materials are being offered in electronic format rather than in paper format to reduce the amount of paper supplies consumed 

	Water & Conservation: Companies closely monitor outdoor irrigation, some are set on timers and only run during specific, set times to In addition, the setting of timers to determine watering schedule allows for the building grounds to be watered with optimum efficiency, thereby reducing over-watering Internally, low- flow fixtures are used to reduce water consumption as well as installation of reverse osmosis system to provide filtered water as an alternative to bottled water and the waste associated 

	Lighting: Some Companies are moving to, converting or already Energy Star Rated buildings or have converted from incandescent lighting to fluorescent, low energy lighting Lighting of buildings at most office locations are set on timers during core business hours, with limited use on nights and weekends  Some locations have motion activated sensors for lighting so that energy is automatically conserved when an area is not being used  Externally, parking garage lighting is set on a timer schedule and only provides lighting during scheduled hours of the day

	Heating and Cooling: Companies monitor usage of heating and cooling systems and many set heat pumps back during non-business hours to conserve energy usage During non-standard business hours, heating and cooling can be limited to areas where an employee is based and is on a timer scheduled system, thereby eliminating the need to heat or cool an entire building for an individual during non-standard business hours Regular, scheduled preventative maintenance is done on heating and cooling systems to ensure optimum efficiency and cut down on any possible wasted energy Additionally, one of the Companies has 2 HVAC chiller systems that are environmentally friendly and operate during the summer months to cut down on humidity within the building and aid in keeping the energy exertion of the air conditioning to a lower level  

	Technology: The internet and technology are increasingly used to leverage reducing consumption of natural resources  Company intranet pages and emails are encouraged as a main source of communication IPads are available to some employees to minimize the need to print reports and materials for meetings with internal and external customers Additionally, the use of social media sites (Twitter and LinkedIn) provides an opportunity to communicate information electronically without the need for printing hard copies Other companies share an office location and a data center that allows for them to consolidate the amount of energy and resources used 

Increasingly offices are installing power shut offs on all desk computer systems to further save on energy during non-standard business hours and weekends Video/web conferencing is also becoming more common amongst offices to reduce the frequency of travel, but still allow individuals to meet on work-related topics as required 

	Transportation: Carpooling has been adopted by a number of the offices as a means to cut down on the number of cars on the road and reduce emissions released by vehicles  Additionally, public transit and alternative means of transportation are encouraged over the traditional methods A designated bicycle storage facility was added an office building to promote the use of greener means of transportation to and from work, whether that be biking to work or using public transportation and then biking to the office

Telecommuting is becoming more widely accepted, as it allows for individuals to remote in and work from their home, save on fuel costs, reduce the number of cars on the road and also cut down on the emissions released into the air by vehicles  Company cars that are either hybrid and/or get 30+ mpg are used as a means of reducing emissions and fuel costs   Some offices position themselves or relocate to areas where most staff can easily use public transport to get to and from work, rather than driving personal vehicles 
Some business units are beginning to open up satellite office(s) that allow Berkley employees located in nearby vicinities to share office space and also cut down travel time significantly for employees who may live closer to the satellite office than to the home office of the company for which they are employed

We encourage our associates to carpool through a small cash reimbursement for the driver and preferred reserved parking spots allocated to only those who carpool
We continue to increase awareness of environmental issues among our associates as we seek to recycle, reduce use of and reuse resources and therefore reduce scope 2 or 3 emissions During 2016 we recycled 250 tons of paper and 24 tons of cardboard In addition, we recycled nearly 13 tons of aluminum cans and plastic bottles We also recycled 25 tons of electronics equipment, 2 tons of printer toners and donated nearly 11 tons of old company supplies to an organization that supports local schools 
In addition, associates organized a community shred day event resulting in recycling approximately 7,000 pounds of paper and 3,000 pounds of electronic media These initiatives are voluntary and ongoing with no foreseeable end date, but implementation is considered complete  
In 2015, the company implemented a managed print program, which is expected to reduce electricity, toner and paper use over time No desktop printers were purchased in 2016 as a result of this project This project resulted in an 86 percent reduction in the number of devices in use at our headquarters  As a part of this ongoing program, nearly 1,000 devices were recycled, while 4,000 devices were donated to organizations that support local schools and communities  
We continue to reduce reliance on postal mail for the delivery of policies and marketing materials to and communications with the agents that sell our products We are committed to serving our customers locally, placing field associates (approximately one-third of our total employees) near the agencies and policyholders they serve, reducing their need for planes, trains and longer automobile trips  We communicate the risks associated with heightened weather activity, including those that may be exacerbated by climate change, in our annual disclosure to shareholders on form 10K and highlight our sustainability efforts on our website

Farmers Insurance Company of Washington,"  As an organization, Farmers recognizes that it is essential that we consider the impact we have on the environment, and that we create and foster a culture where all individuals are aware of opportunities to conserve energy and natural resources

We have initiatives in process that reduce our carbon footprint  These include changes in the way we manage our facilities, our fleet, and our travel 

Our goal is to purchase energy in an efficient, cost effective and environmentally responsible manner, and to establish and implement effective energy management programs

Our facility in Caledonia, MI, has replaced existing HID parking lot and road lights with more energy efficient LED lighting, and reduced the number of light heads on poles These LED fixtures are typically 50% - 75% more energy efficient and have a useful life of 72,000 hours (82 years with 24/7 use) There will be continued energy savings with projected carbon savings over the next 10 years of 2,145 tonnes CO2 In 2015 we have installed the same energy efficient lighting in Lake Mary, FL, which will result in continued energy reduction saving in Kilowatt usage per year 59,900 kWh/yr or 41 tonnes CO2/yr We have previously installed a new Cool Roof product at one of our facilities and have installed solar panels in two other locations  We continue to implement electrical power conservation programs in multiple operations  In some locations we have installed motion sensitive light switches and energy saving light bulbs (such as ALTO lights from Phillips, which are recognized by the industry as energy-efficient lighting solutions) In Austin, TX we have converted our 190,000 sq ft office and also our 9,000 sq ft office in McAllen, TX over to 100% green electricity through electricity provider contracts  To continue our efforts, in 2015 we have also converted our 24,960 sq ft facility in Cherry Hill, NJ to green electricity and will continue to look for additional opportunities, where available In Grand Rapids, MI we have replaced (4) 25+ year old elevators with more energy efficient elevators which are projected to save $5,000 annually in electricity costs  In addition to these improvements, we have also implemented programs to remind employees to power down equipment when it is not in use  Many computer monitors and desktop computers are automatically set to go into a sleep or hibernation mode after a short period of inactivity

Depending on job assignment, employees may be provided with a company fleet vehicle  Since  2010, more fuel efficient, 4 cylinder vehicles have been selected for our general lines vehicles and the number of unassigned and pool vehicles at our various office locations has been reduced  Gallons of fuel and tons of CO2 emitted in 2015 were 72% lower than 2014  A 51% reduction in the total tons of CO2 over this six year time period has been attained due to fewer vehicles in service, fewer miles driven and the decision to down-size from full-size to mid-size and compact vehicles 

As many Farmers employees commute to our business locations, we encourage ridesharing and the use of public transportation  In some locations, we provide incentives including subsidies for train passes, bus passes and vanpools, free shuttle buses from train stations, and preferred carpool parking spaces  Farmers has also installed four electric charging stations  at two facilities in California to provide an energy source for those employees who already drive electric vehicles and to also encourage more environmentally friendly vehicle use

Telepresence technology and high quality HD video conferencing systems in many operations have helped minimize airline travel   

In addition to our focus on the reduction of emissions we have made improvements in our effort to reduce water consumption  Improvements include low volume sink faucets, low volume toilets, and waterless urinals  Other improvements within our operations include upgrades to programmable irrigation systems and pop-up sprinkler heads, which eliminate leakage and overspray

We continue to work on reducing utilization of paper and office supplies  Copier/printer machines in     many of our locations are set for duplex (two-sided) printing and the print/copy default has been set to black and white vs color   Farmers has implemented an MDS optimization program within Document Logistics, replacing multi-functional devises with more energy efficient equipment This program was put into place not only to reduce energy consumption and the impact on the environment, but to also ensure cost savings We have completed the second year of this program, which will reduce the number of multifunctional devices (MDF) within our office buildings from 3,269 to 1,522 machines (53% reduction) and replace the remaining 47% with more energy efficient equipment; projecting an energy cost savings of $195,098, 1,300,653 KWh and 895 tonnes of CO2 over a 3 year period

Virtually all employee communications are handled electronically rather than through paper  As of 2011, semi-monthly statements of employee earnings and deductions have been electronically available and are no longer printed and mailed to employees  Improved ordering processes have lowered the volume of consumable supplies in many locations  Recycling programs have been implemented for paper, plastic, cardboard and glass  Printer, copier ink and toner cartridges are also recycled, as are cell phones, chargers and obsolete electronic equipment such as computers and monitors  In our mail rooms, we have begun recycling and reusing packing materials for shipping  
 
We have implemented initiatives that provide customers with environmentally friendly choices that also reduce the organizations carbon footprint For example, in some operations, mail sent to agents and customers is delivered in envelopes made of recycled material  A new billing system available in some states and for some products provides increased on-line billing and payment capabilities  In some states and for some products, we are working to provide customers with the option to receive electronic policy forms and notices from us, rather than paper copies  Customers with these electronic policies may also have the option to receive bills, pay bills, and view their billing histories online  Some states prohibit the use of paperless communication with policyholders, which limits our ability to consider paperless options 

Our MultiCar auto policy, available in some states, can cover multiple vehicles on one policy, thereby reducing the amount of paper customers receive and our overall carbon footprint

In 2010, Farmers built a 164,000 SF facility in Oklahoma City that was recognized by the US Green Building Council as qualifying for Core and Shell LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) certification at the silver level, and also qualified for LEED certification for the Tenant Improvement portion of the project  1400 employees moved into the building in October 2010 and continue to work there today  

In some of our larger facilities: 1) ice and water machines are provided, reducing plastic bottled water consumption; 2) programmable thermostats are in place; 3) carbon footprint studies and energy audits have been completed; 4) Energy Star equipment is purchased whenever practical; 5) cleaning hours were revised to allow for more daytime cleaning, allowing us to deactivate interior lights earlier in the evening; 6) new employees are informed of our green business practices during their initial training classes and existing employees receive regular electronic communications on various energy-related topics, keeping awareness at a high level

In addition the two Print and Distribution Centers in North America have implemented several significant initiatives to mitigate impacts to the environment including: aggressive approach to deliver agent, customer and broker documents electronically versus traditional USPS mail;  On-line report viewing; purchasing of envelopes and stationary manufactured with paper from trees harvested from forests that are SFI (Sustainable Forestry Initiative) certified, Print-On-Demand of agent support materials versus warehoused stored materials; digitizing as much in-bound mail as possible via an active imaging approach; implemented many initiatives improving efficiency, lowering energy consumption, actively participating in operational recycling program, consolidating operations to a  two-site COE model and reducing operational waste from 4% to less than 2%",0
Vantapro Specialty Insurance Company," AW US clearly recognize that catastrophic loss can pose a major risk to our capital We invest in substantial resources and funds into our cat modeling process In addition to purchasing several catastrophic modeling programs we also utilize internal exposure caps by geographic locations in order to ensure that no one catastrophe (AKA one in 250 year event) will cause a drop in capital of more than 20% All exposures to risk are reviewed annually by the Risk Management committee Exposures are reviewed and rated based on factors like probability, speed of onset, advance warning and duration We also look at the impact on staff, facilities, systems and an overall aggregate impact These are all weighed against a probability factor and the result is a weighted ranking of risk The higher the ranking the more attention is paid to mitigating that risk and bringing it into an acceptable rating",2
MCIC Vermont,"  MCIC does not see climate change as likely to have a significant impact to the risks we underwrite  Further, MCIC is a captive reciprocal risk retention group, and our main insureds are also our owners with their own climate change policies  MCIC does not employ any risk modeling regarding climate change, but employs outside actuaries to track risk trends generally",7
Adirondack Ins Exchange," Over the past year, we have made improvements to our buildings to help reduce our electrical consumption leading to overall reduction of GHG emissions These improvements include:
	Installation of motion sensors in many of the buildings we occupy that automatically turn lights off after periods of inactivity 
	Installation of building automation control units to better manage and direct electrical usage
	Using of flat screen televisions which are generally rated at high-level energy efficiency with automatic shut-off feature
	Installation of LED lights in buildings 
As an example, all of these initiatives have helped reduce our average daily electrical consumption at our Winston-Salem locations by 55% in the past 3 months, when compared to our electricity consumption from the prior year

New Hampshire Insurance Company," ClimateWise leads collaborative research and analysis initiatives that may indirectly influence public policy on climate change For example, AIG participated in the ClimateWise Collaboration on City Resilience, focusing on the importance of urban resilience to the insurance industry, and what the sector can do to respond to increasing climate change related risks to cities In 2012, the ClimateWise convened city leaders, key sector clients such as property owners and utility companies, and insurers to focus on the question, How do we accelerate action to in long-term resilience to keep American cities performing in the face of more extreme and unpredictable climate risks? 

As a member of ClimateWise, AIG also responds to the annual ClimateWise survey on performance against six principles of sustainability: leading in risk analysis, informing public policy-making, supporting climate awareness amongst customers, incorporating climate change into investment strategies, reducing the environmental impact of business, and reporting and being accountable According to ClimateWise, these Principles enable leading insurers to work together to respond to the myriad risks and opportunities of climate change, aiming to reduce the overall risks faced by economies and societies

Next, as an annual respondent to the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP), AIG is voluntarily part of the key constituency of companies and cities that measure, disclose, manage and share vital environmental information about both our impact on the environment and our actions to reduce impacts In early 2013, AIG also became a member of CDP Reporter Services, which provides data, support and insights to reduce emissions and improve business performance As a member, AIG can benchmark performance against peers and identify material risks and opportunities using CDPs vast source of primary climate-change data 

Finally, by joining the New York City Mayors Carbon Challenge, AIG is part of a NYC constituency that includes 17 of the leading universities, the 11 largest hospital systems, and nine other global commercial corporations with significant office space in New York City The Mayor's Carbon Challenge invites these private and institutional sectors to voluntarily reduce their greenhouse gas emissions intensity by 30% over 10 years Together, these participants account for nearly 4% of citywide emissions, meaning that our efforts will translate to a 13% reduction in citywide emissions, assuming no change in baseline square feet 

Commercial buildings account for 21% of New York City's emissions, and energy use in interior offices and leased spaces account for between 40-60% of end use in a typical commercial office building As one of the 10 participants in the challenge to commercial offices, AIG will focus on energy efficiency in interior office spaces and leased spaces through innovative strategies such as IT efficiency, plug load reductions, space layout optimization, and lighting upgrades

Internal

AIG internally engages with employees on the topic of climate change and sustainability in various ways:

The following describes risks driven by changes in regulation:

Risk driver: General environmental regulations including planning;
Description: Aetna considers itself indirectly exposed to regulatory risks related to greenhouse gas emissions As a US-based insurance benefits corporation, Aetna does not produce products or services leading directly to the emissions of substantial amounts of greenhouse gases or other pollutants Aetna considers the impact to this driver to be from additional costs associated with regulatory compliance; Potential impact: Increased operational cost;
Time-frame: >6 years;
Direct/Indirect: Indirect (supply chain);
Likeli-hood: About as likely as not;
Magnitude of impact: Low;
Estimated financial implications: Unknown Aetna operations are housed predominately in leased locations with minimal fuel burning equipment on-site Any regulatory risk is expected to be generated by Aetna's purchase of electricity or fuels  As the majority of Aetna leases include electricity and other utilities in the lease rate, the amount Aetna pays may increase, although by how much is uncertain
Management method: Unknown The majority of Aetna leases are multi-year If regulations were to drive electrical and fuel costs higher, it is expected that these increased costs would be passed on to Aetna If that were the case then Aetna could pursue separate metering allowing Aetna the opportunity to handle the costs directly and then to implement measures to lower electricity and fuel costs to reap any savings
Cost of mgt: Unknown

Strathmore Insurance Company," GNY achieves its biggest impact in reducing losses by utilizing Loss Control services Loss Control services identify exposures to loss and makes recommendations, when necessary, to mitigate losses and to reduce frequency and severity of losses caused by both weather-related and non-weather-related perils For example, if a roof is old and worn, a recommendation would be made to replace the roof so that the likelihood of a loss is reduced or eliminated New roofs make buildings stronger and more resilient This lessens the financial impact of an event not just to our insured, but to the community as well These types of recommendations are important and effective, since the building inventory in our country is aging, and many structures require such remediation Other risk-control recommendations include requiring insureds to upgrade electrical, plumbing, and heating systems if too old or not well maintained Newer systems and appliances are much more efficient than older ones  An additional benefit is that these newer systems and appliances also reduce the carbon footprint",5

Humana also sees our value chain as key constituencies and an extension of our business We engage with suppliers to assess how partnerships can drive collective impact in the areas of sustainability and efficiency Such initiatives have focused on sustainable procurement and increasing waste diversion throughout our supply chain 

Our fourth release of the Supplier Self-Assessment Sustainability Scorecard engaged more suppliers than the previous year For instance, we collect metrics such as whether the suppliers have environmental policies, management systems, supplier sustainability policies, hold green building certifications, among others Humana invited 78 suppliers to participate in the survey in 2020 21 of our suppliers responded for a rate of 27% Those 21 suppliers made up approximately $800M in 2020 spend, which represented about 20% of our total spend in 2020  The Scorecard requests are distributed via email and responses are collected through self-reporting of the suppliers Pending our availability, we follow up through one-on-one engagement Via the Scorecard, we collect information from key suppliers regarding their efforts to reduce the environmental impacts associated with their vendor engagement with Humana  This initiative helped us understand the environmental impact of our vendor relationships and set the stage for more robust data collection; findings are reported in our CSR report updates, internal scorecard, and to Humana leadership  We aim to expand this initiative in the future by engaging suppliers that represent the greatest impact As our supply chain program evolves, implementation of the supplier scorecard process will be evaluated on its ability to support our efforts in meeting CDP expectations, assist with sourcing decisions, mitigate risk, and be used as a tracking tool for business reviews  We have strengthened our approach by initiating information requests for larger suppliers during the contract renewal or new vendor engagement process; this underscores our intention to maintain this practice for these suppliers on an annual basis

After setting new emissions reduction and waste diversion targets to ensure continued improvement in 2018 and beyond, we engaged a new facilities management vendor with formalized expectations of their collaborative requirements to ensure attainment of our new targets These expectations were included in the RFP when soliciting bids in an effort to elevate our sustainability progress; responding vendors then provided their expertise and recommendations to help us achieve our sustainability targets, which informed our final decision-making  

We also proactively work to connect our suppliers and associates to identify opportunities to collaborate and improve our environmental sustainability For example, several suppliers presented at multiple sustainability fairs held at Humana in 2016 and 2017, allowing associates to understand how the procured services address sustainability During our Inclusion & Diversity Day, employees were encouraged to provide feedback on supplier sustainability efforts

Our employee community reached Humanas Associate Bold Goal by the end of 2018, reducing Unhealthy Days by 20% and giving employees 23 million more Healthy Days as a community Upon reaching that milestone, an ambitious new goal was created to inspire everyone to go further: to achieve 500,000 more Healthy Days by the end of 2022 In addition to Healthy Days, our new Associate Bold Goal includes a team element: our target is for 90% of our teams to improve their well-being  Teaming up with community nonprofits, business leaders, local government officials and city councils, we joined in conversations and partnerships that required us to listen and learn We came back to the drawing board time and time again to figure out more and better ways to impact health outcomes and support initiatives that were important to sustaining communities Those conversations led us to take a hard look at social determinants of health to understand how we can best connect community members to the necessary¿resources and support, building towards¿sustainable solutions We have partnered with AIR Louisville using technology, data analytics, and community collaboration to better understand the environmental triggers of asthma that afflicts almost 13% of the population in the city where we are headquartered The intention of this program is to identify the causes of asthma, which will then help our city leaders make smarter decisions about air quality Weve embedded the Bold Goal approach into 16 communities across the country

California Automobile Insurance Company," Those regulations, however, do not allow insurers to consider the impact of climate change, so Mercurys rates will be inadequate to the extent that future fires or storms are more frequent and/or more severe than what exists in our historic data  Although the company cannot add the cost of reinsurance to our rates in California, we have purchased reinsurance coverage for our California business, and as the effects of climate change cause more frequent or more severe catastrophic events, the cost of catastrophe reinsurance coverage will rise

Because our view of wildfire risk has evolved, we now have moratoriums in place around the state of California, in areas where we feel our aggregate exposure has become too high  Even if rates were adequate to pay for expected loss costs and to cover our net cost of reinsurance, we would still have to manage our aggregate exposure to loss in order to survive the very largest events

We have licensed the AIR Worldwide Touchstone family of models so that we can do more extensive modeling and analysis of wildfire, earthquake and fire following earthquake, hurricane and such analyses In addition to wildfire Mercury faces climate change risk related to increases in hurricane frequency and severity  Because of the predicted increase in hurricane frequency, Mercury is taking numerous steps to monitor, control or even reduce exposure to catastrophic losses caused by hurricanes We have purchased a catastrophe reinsurance treaty to help manage the exposure to hurricanes and other weather-related disasters We revise our rates to take exposure to weather-related events into account We model exposure to weather-related events at least quarterly to help manage our exposure And, if aggregate exposure gets too large, we implement restrictions to slow the growth in exposure to acceptable levels These exposure management plans are reviewed by senior management

The companys business continuity and disaster preparedness plans do contemplate hurricanes and other windstorm as potential threats to operations To the extent that the frequency and severity of such events may be affected by climate change, they will be incorporated into the business continuity plan

All of the factors above and below are considered within the companys enterprise risk management structure, ultimately reporting to the board of directors, but the company does not have a dedicated point-person or team specifically focused on climate change strategies The company does not have a formal climate change policy with respect to investments and has not issued a public statement on its climate policy (please see question #5 below for more information)

CompBenefits Company,"1% of Humanas total $46,138,000,000 operating budget Though operating expense increases due to energy taxes and regulations would have a material impact on budgetary costs, the overall operational cost impact for the portfolio would be minimal

Humana's Workplace Solutions team continuously evaluates short term and long term regulatory risks around energy and carbon A combination of forecasted energy costs due to general commodity price pressures, taxes and regulations or other impact is evaluated by the team to manage evolving financial exposure to energy prices In order to curb projected increases, the team works to budget for cost and environmental impact mitigation efforts such as energy efficiency projects to manage this risk This resulted in the formulation of an aggressive energy and carbon reduction target for the portfolio in efforts to manage operating costs and reduce Humana's environmental impacts

Risks driven by changes in physical climate parameters 
Increases in average temperature could result in more cooling degree days for Humana's data centers which could increase cooling loads at these and other locations

Any rise in average temperature that results in more cooling degree days throughout the year could increase cooling costs at Humana facilities, and in particular the company's data centers  Based on peer-reviewed research published in 2014, Humana has estimated the cost implications of rising data center energy consumption due to an increase in cooling degree days The potential aggregate estimated cost increase from 2015-2030 is $668,000, which is less than 01% of Humanas $46,138,000,000 operating budget

Humana has worked with its equipment partners, done extensive modelling of air flow and cooling loads, and is implementing optimization strategies to minimize the cost of cooling and reduce the temperature differential required, while maintaining the reliability and performance of its data center equipment  For example, the installation of high efficiency motors and variable frequency drives (VFDs) in our data centers have resulted in energy efficiency while also prolong the life of the systems, resulting in increased reliability through the life of the equipment

While Humana does not have a direct cost associated with managing cooling degree days, past and ongoing investment in data center energy efficiency mitigates the risk by reducing overall energy consumption For example, Humana continues to use modeling software and tools purchased prior to the reporting period to optimize air flow and cooling needs In addition, we invested $663,000 in data center energy efficiency projects in 2015 that were projected to reduce energy costs by nearly $196,000 annually

Significant weather events could also negatively impact our business by disrupting regular operations and limiting accessibility for our associates as well as our members As our data centers have disaster recovery methods in place to manage for risks unrelated to climate change, the estimated financial implications of this type of service disruption are considered to be low Our alternate/backup locations for the medical centers located in Florida have been prioritized to mitigate against hurricanes and other weather events, for which the financial implications are difficult to assess

To decrease the potential of business interruption due to a significant weather event, Humana's data centers maintain two separate power inputs, from different grids The centers also maintain a robust generator system that can provide power for 3-5 days before requiring re-fueling, while fuel service is contracted for a priority refill if requested Dual cooling systems are also in place Data center exterior walls were built to exceed ""tornado-level"" winds of over 100 mph, and both data centers are built on land not susceptible to flooding Humana maintains a secondary data center to support disaster recovery of technical systems In addition to our facility-specific management methods, Humana also has a robust work at home program, allowing staff to work remotely should there be an instance of reduced accessibility/pandemic or other issue

The management methods described, including the data center specifications, our Business Continuity Program, and our work at home program, are considered to be routine operations for Humana to manage for several risks and opportunities in addition to the potential effects of climate change

Changes to the frequency and severity of natural catastrophes, especially hurricanes, pose risk to our business Farmers uses both internal and external catastrophe models to make its best assessment of prospective catastrophe risk for pricing purposes, subject to regulatory requirements Our modeling work generates outputs on a deterministic and probabilistic basis, which we use to manage our enterprise view of risk

While the modeling data and outputs continue to improve over time, there is still uncertainty around the outputs Farmers considers this uncertainty in our selection and pricing of risk, and our overall tolerance of catastrophe exposure

American Economy Insurance Company," The Company is a member of the Institute of International Finance and a sponsor of the Wharton Risk Management and Decisions Processes Center at the University of Pennsylvania, both of which are engaged in ongoing initiatives and research to assess the potential impacts of climate change on the insurance industry and its customers and to develop or support appropriate strategies that enable the industry to address and communicate these impacts 

Liberty Mutual is also a member of the Insurance Institute for Business & Home Safety (IBHS) The following text, prepared by IBHS, is a brief description of the Institute and some of its activities that relate to the issue of climate change

IBHS is a 501(c)(3) organization, wholly supported by the property (re)insurance industry, which conducts objective, scientific research to identify and promote effective actions that strengthen homes, businesses, and communities against natural disasters and other causes of loss IBHS does this by identifying and advocating improved property design, construction, retrofitting, maintenance, repair, and preparation practices IBHS guidance for mitigating property losses is available directly to the public and to our members/policyholders, at wwwdisastersafetyorg, and through social media (eg, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, YouTube, and Vimeo)

IBHS advocates the concept of going green and building strong recognizing that addressing climate change involves both reducing greenhouse gas emissions and adapting homes, businesses, and communities to severe weather that may result from climate change:

 As an insurance-supported organization, IBHS recognizes that climate change strategies must do more than build structures to be energy efficient They must be built to modern fire protection standards to help resist fire and avoid the water/chemical deluge needed for fire suppression; they should be strong enough to avoid wind destruction and resulting relocation in landfills; and properties should be sited and elevated in a manner that protects against flooding and environmental degradation from landslides All of these are part of going green

 IBHS also firmly believes that adaptation is critical, not only to reduce long-term property insurance losses, but to buttress individual and societal resilience All of the property protection measures that IBHS advocates to strengthen structures against current weather threats will also reduce future losses caused by climate change events In addition, the unprecedented scientific research conducted at the unique IBHS Research Center is critical to identification of new mitigation actions that may help protect against more severe weather events

 Additionally, research conducted by IBHS will help to make sure that green building enhancements do not inadvertently cause structures to be less disaster-resistant, or even worse, threaten the life safety of occupants or first respondersfor example, photovoltaic arrays that take flight or pose fire suppression challenges are the antithesis of building strong 

Engagement of policyholders is provided in several ways The Company offers discounts to policyholders that have taken specific steps to reduce their susceptibility to extreme weather events through structural modifications to their properties Policyholders are incentivized to reduce their CO2 emissions through products that cover structural modifications such as installed solar panels with full replacement guarantees, and discounts for hybrid vehicles Other products and endorsements allow for replacement of existing mechanical equipment and appliances with upgraded high efficiency units in the event of a loss The Company also has Loss Prevention units staffed by engineers and other technical experts who consult directly with commercial property owners and develop detailed plans for actions that can be taken to reduce the susceptibility of losses due to severe weather events",6
Mutual of America Life insurance Company," The Companys Home Office in New York City also has an uninterrupted power supply system, and the Home Office and the National Telecommunications and Conference Center both have back-up generator systems capable of supplying power for up to 48 hours or more, depending on usage, along with vendor contracts to supply fuel for the generator systems as may be necessary In 2015, the Company enhanced electrical cabling throughout its Home Office building and increased the availability of emergency generator power to tenants requesting access 

As a result of the Companys post-Superstorm Sandy review of its Business Continuity Plans and the reported damage incurred by neighboring facilities not affiliated with the Company, the Company added improvements to its Home Office, which included the installation of additional drains and pumps to mitigate the risk of flooding, the raising of fuel pumps for generator operations and ensuring redundant electrical circuits to provide power from emergency generators 

The post-Superstorm Sandy review also identified a concern with the location of the Companys designated Disaster Recovery Site for its mainframe applications in New Jersey The area in which the Disaster Recovery Site is located was heavily flooded, although the Disaster Recovery Site itself was not flooded nor its operations interrupted After careful analysis, the Company determined that there was a risk that the Companys Home Office, its National Telecommunications and Conference Center, and its designated Disaster Recovery Site could be affected by the same storm or incident, such as a wide-spread power outage of the Eastern Power Grid and not be available for an extended period Given the risk, the Company determined that it would be prudent to move its recovery site to a facility operated by the same vendor that is located in Scottsdale, Arizona, which is on the Western Power Grid In January 2015, the Company completed the successful changeover from its prior mainframe Disaster Recovery Site to it new site in Scottsdale Moving the Disaster Recovery Site to Scottsdale mitigates the risk that the Home Office, the National Telecommunications and Conference Center, and the designated Disaster Recovery Site would be affected by the same storm or incident

The Company implemented the Disaster Recovery Plan in conjunction with Hurricane Dorian in 2019 The assigned Disaster Recovery Teams were deployed to the Disaster Recovery Site in Scottsdale and to the Home Office in New York City It was not necessary, however, to shut down the National Telecommunications and Conference Center and transfer computer operations to either Scottsdale or New York City The Company provided uninterrupted service to its customers during Hurricane Dorian

The Company conducts at least two disaster recovery tests during the year The tests conducted since the relocation of the Disaster Recovery Site to Scottsdale have been successful

Swiss Re Life & Health America Inc.,") as part of its risk management and underwriting process Swiss Re disclosed such risks in its 2017 Annual Report under the TCFD disclosure guidelines 

The company supplements this process with research into climate change and its economic impact Swiss Re's Sustainability unit coordinates our climate change engagement, including our program of climate risk research  

Swiss Res Catastrophe Perils unit includes experts in windstorm, tropical cyclone and flooding This unit is responsible for the design and maintenance of the company's natural catastrophe loss models and supports the assessment of climate related risks as part of the underwriting process for our insurance and reinsurance activities Guided by collaboration with leading scientific institutions, the latest scientific knowledge, and loss experiences the models are updated on a regular basis The company's risk and premium calculations are based on the probabilistic hazard models, which are based on historic events To ensure our models and pricing calculations remain accurate going forward in a changing climate, we have to make sure that we identify significant future trends in natural hazards, quantify their long term impact on insured losses and include findings in our risk models and underwriting processes

Understanding natural catastrophe risks and the impact of climate change is critical to cost our business accurately and to structure sound risk transfer solutions The damage caused by floods, storms, earthquakes and other natural disasters can affect millions of lives and the economies of entire countries In 2017, the hurricanes in the Caribbean and the US, the typhoons in Australia and Asia, winter storms and flooding in Europe, wildfires in California and Europe, and two earthquakes in Mexico proved the point again Total economic losses from natural and man-made catastrophes were more than USD 337 billion for the full year - of these, approximately USD 144 billion were insured Insurance payouts helped many to restore their lives, but even more were left with nothing once they could return to what was their home This shows that there remains a large need to reduce the negative effects of natural disasters  let alone to assure the funds needed to rebuild affected communities after an event  In 2017, our clients in P&C Reinsurance paid us USD 23 billion of natural catastrophe premiums (for losses larger than USD 20 million), equivalent to approximately 14% of total premiums in this business segment
Swiss Re's research on the economics of climate adaptation (ECA) has a specific focus on the impact of climate change on local economies ECA studies quantify todays climate risks, the potential increase of populations and assets at risk due to economic development, plus the additional risk posed by climate change, with a time horizon of up to 30 years In a second step, our studies identify cost-effective measures to minimize and adapt to these risks In this way, ECA studies provide decision makers with important information needed to integrate climate adaptation with economic development, paving the way for sustainable growth 

On the investment side, we screen our portfolio on a number of ESG criteria, including climate change, and specifically carbon emissions, regularly and with the support of an external vendor Furthermore, we measure our exposure to carbon emissions in listed equities and corporate bonds in a systematic manner In order to mitigate the risk of stranded assets, we have also adopted a policy to avoid investments in companies that generate 30% or more of their revenues from thermal coal mining or that use at least 30% thermal coal for power generation

Carolina Casualty Insurance Company,"  Each company receives data on its exposures and has been provided with mapping software developed specifically for the monitoring and modeling of catastrophes  This mapping software allows each company to identify its exposed limits by line of business and type of exposure (buildings, contents, business interruption), the number of locations, and the actual policies that are exposed in a particular area
	Each operating company includes within its business plan the catastrophe exposed limits they anticipate for the next year by region and county tier; the ERM and Catastrophe teams monitor each company against their planned aggregate over the course of each year
	The ERM team identifies to both senior management and to our operating companies those locations and policies which are most likely to give rise to a substantial loss from hurricane
	Both senior management and our operating companies are regularly provided with updates on the latest published articles and reports on climate change as part of our emerging issues weekly update report
	The Group restricts its investments in municipal bonds in areas that are most subject to catastrophic loss
	The ERM and Investment teams coordinate to monitor the Group exposure to municipal bonds in those states that are most likely to experience significant catastrophes
	When considering real estate purchases, the Investment team considers the exposure to catastrophe at that location  When there is a risk of catastrophe, the ERM team works with the Investment team to assess that risk, and this assessment is taken into consideration when determining whether to proceed with the purchase
Investment Management perspective, the companies look at: 
	The investment department does not maintain a specific climate change policy with respect to investment management In the normal course of researching and performing due diligence on investment opportunities, the investment department assesses many different risk factors including (but not limited to) inflation, demographic shifts, economic trends, management issues, interest rates, consumer behavior, competitive forces,  credit risk, political risk, convexity risk, climate change, and others The investment department does not maintain specific policies for any of these other risk factors either but attempts to assess the impact that each of them will have on our ability to realize the desired rate of return that is modeled for each investment  For each type of investment, the relevant risk factors mentioned above will be subjected to sensitivity analysis to determine their relative impact on the expected returns Therefore, if one of the most relevant risk factors for a given investment opportunity was identified as climate change (an energy investment for example), then various scenarios would be run at different cost structures and revenue levels to assess the impact on operating margins as a result of changing energy consumption patterns, competitive pressures from substitute products, regulatory decisions, penalties and fees, lawsuits, changes in law, etc

Kaiser Permanente Insurance Company (KPIC),"
The Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) concluded in 2013 that an increase in extreme weather events, coupled with the spread of infectious diseases, and food and water scarcity, are likely to present material implications for the managed care industry through an increase in covered medical expenses SASB also noted that an increase in the frequency of extreme weather events has the potential to impact costs and liabilities by generating additional covered medical expenses and that the associated risks could lead to an increased cost of capital Higher incidence of disease could negatively affect both clinical and non-clinical staff availability, resulting in higher expenditures on sick leave and backfilling The financial implications of these health-related impacts are difficult to quantify Changes in physical climate may also affect the efficiency of our facility operations, including increased power and water consumption necessary to maintain the indoor environment of our hospitals and patient care buildings
According to the US Global Change Research Programs published 2016 scientific assessment of the impacts of climate change on human health in the United States:
Current and future climate impacts expose more people in more places to public health threats Already in the United States, we have observed climate-related increases in our exposure to elevated temperatures; more frequent, severe, or longer-lasting extreme events; degraded air quality; diseases transmitted through food, water, and disease vectors (such as ticks and mosquitoes); and stresses to our mental health and well¬being Almost all of these threats are expected to worsen with continued climate change Some of these health threats will occur over longer time periods, or at unprecedented times of the year; some people will be exposed to threats not previously experienced in their locations Overall, instances of potentially beneficial health impacts of climate change are limited in number and pertain to specific regions or populations For example, the reduction in cold-related deaths is projected to be smaller than the increase in heat-related deaths in most regions Every American is vulnerable to the health impacts associated with climate change Increased exposure to multiple health threats, together with changes in sensitivity and the ability to adapt to those threats, increases a persons vulnerability to climate-related health effects The impacts of climate change on human health interact with underlying health, demographic, and socioeconomic factors Through the combined influence of these factors, climate change exacerbates some existing health threats and creates new public health challenges While all Americans are at risk, some populations are disproportionately vulnerable, including those with low income, some communities of color, immigrant groups (including those with limited English proficiency), Indigenous peoples, children and pregnant women, older adults, vulnerable occupational groups, persons with disabilities, and persons with preexisting or chronic medical conditions
In the April 4, 2013 edition of the New England Journal of Medicine, McMichael identifies three categories of climate-change risks to health, along with their causal pathway:
1	Primary: Direct biologic consequences of heat waves, extreme weather events, and temperature-enhanced levels of urban air pollutants;
2	Secondary: Risks mediated by changes in biophysically and ecologically based processes and systems, particularly food yields, water flows, infectious-disease vectors, and (for zoonotic diseases) intermediate-host ecology; and
3	Tertiary: More diffuse effects (eg, mental health problems in failing farm communities, displaced groups, disadvantaged indigenous and minority ethnic groups); consequences of tension and conflict owing to climate changerelated declines in basic resources (water, food, timber, living space)
With regard to primary risks, climate change directly impacts the populations in all geographical areas that KP serves While all regions in which KP operates are at risk of illnesses and loss of life due to extreme temperatures, the specific risk exposures may vary For example, while the Northern and Southern California regions are particularly affected by droughts, wildfires and heat waves, the Mid-Atlantic States and Georgia are more prone to severe storms and storm surges Hawaii and the Pacific Northwest are relatively more exposed to coastal flooding as well as heat waves In general, global warming can aggravate the effects of pre-existing health conditions such as chronic respiratory disease and asthma, due to increases in air pollutants and aeroallergens There is evidence of declining air quality in cities since greater heat can also worsen air pollution such as ground-level ozone or smog According to the National Center for Health Statistics, overall current asthma prevalence among adults increased from 20012002 (71%) to 20132014 (92%) By weight status, prevalence increased among overweight adults but not among adults in the obese or normal weight categoriesWith regard to secondary risks, climate-related disturbances in ecological systems, such as changes in the range of infective parasites, can increase the incidence of serious infectious diseases The tick that carries Lyme Disease is reported in 457% of US counties, up from 30% in 19983 Other secondary health effects of global warming include water- and food-borne diseases Warm temperatures also increase water pollution which harms human health In rural areas, increased food insecurity can occur due to geographical shifts in optimum growing conditions and decreases in crop yields; reduced water resources for agriculture and for human consumption; and loss of property such as cropland because of floods, droughts and a rise in sea level
With regard to tertiary risks, according to The Medical Society Consortium on Climate and Health: Many people exposed to the worst extreme weather events experience stress and serious mental health consequences including depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and increases in suicidal thoughts and behavior Such disasters are also associated with increases in alcohol or drug abuse Children may also experience prolonged separation from their parents Beyond the well-known risks specific disasters pose to our mental health, the physical, social, and economic stresses created by climate change all increase our risk of mental health problems

Because many USAA members reside in catastrophe-prone areas, changing global weather-patterns add complexity to (1) the estimates of actuarially-sound rates in catastrophe-prone areas, especially coastal regions, and (2) the estimates of capital requirements for low-frequency, high-severity events A 2014 Report issued by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), along with other scientific studies published within the last few years, predict more severe droughts and floods, and possibly more intense hurricanes USAA is committed to preserving its  financial strength  and to be there for its members over the long-term and, as such, is taking the uncertainties surrounding natural catastrophes into consideration when setting conservative capital requirements For example, USAAs capital requirements are more conservative than those suggested by regulatory and rating agencies The company is prepared to withstand a 1-in-1,000 years catastrophe event and maintains a much more conservative premium-to-surplus ratio than regulators or rating agencies require USAAs capital requirements are taken into account when setting geographic and financial growth strategies
(2)	Regulatory risks
Currently, rate regulation in the United States typically limits the amount USAA can charge in catastrophe-prone areas to the range of rates indicated by historically-calibrated models Therefore, USAA sets rates based on state-of-the-art modeling software USAA will continue to keep models updated with the latest scientific research incorporated into model assumptions and grow cautiously in catastrophe-prone areas USAA also works with federal, state, and local, state, and federal authorities and  non-profits as well as insurance related organizations, such as: IBHS, and the Federal Alliance for Safe Homes (FLASH), to promote wise geographical growth and building code standards for new construction 
(3)	Business Operation risks
An increase in the frequency and/or severity of catastrophic tropical storms or wild fires could have an impact on USAAs operations The Gulf Coast region and western states which are prone to wildfire could be most significantly impacted USAA has regional offices in both of these areas of the United States, and has contingency plans in place to continue world-class service to members even if a regional office is damaged Claims adjusters have mobile equipment and extensive training to enable USAA to personally respond to members needs quickly and professionally after major catastrophes anywhere in the US USAA also encourages flexible work-at-home program, which may allow employees to work from any location

Torus National Insurance Company," These risks are ranked based upon the likelihood of occurrence and severity of the potential loss Risks with material exposures are addressed in the annual risk plan

National Farmers Union Property and Casualty Company," These estimates may prove to be incorrect and our aggregate claims may exceed our estimates In addition, we take into account the projected implications of climate change on the frequency, severity and potential locations of natural catastrophes and on our business in general 

The Company also utilizes proprietary modeling software which includes some element of assessment of future development of claims within the models An increase in frequency and severity of weather related events will not be a linear increase each year and may be affected by other factors such as cyclical sea surface temperature patterns over decades (eg Atlantic multi decadal oscillation  AMO)

Underwriting decisions are affected by the understanding of changes to severity / frequency events  This results in greater scrutiny of required rates year-on-year in perceived weather exposed regions, greater control of exposures where weather-related issues are prevalent and as necessary, changes to underwriting appetite for risk, reflecting the perceived changes in exposure",2

Farmers Insurance Company of Arizona,"  As an organization, Farmers recognizes that it is essential that we consider the impact we have on the environment, and that we create and foster a culture where all individuals are aware of opportunities to conserve energy and natural resources

We have initiatives in process that reduce our carbon footprint  These include changes in the way we manage our facilities, our fleet, and our travel

Our goal is to purchase energy in an efficient, cost effective and environmentally responsible manner, and to establish and implement effective energy management programs Our facility in Caledonia, MI has upgraded the energy management system in 2018 in a variety of different ways We are expecting approximately $100,000 reduction in annual energy consumption due to installation of 25 variable frequency drives, HVAC specific motion sensing devices and chilled water reset controls We have reduced occupied (on times for HVAC and lighting) by 110 hours per month and retrofitted atrium lights to LED to eliminate labor costs and 24 hour run times on common area lighting In addition, we installed new LED light panels in the kitchen area and saw an 85% reduction in energy consumption To ensure ongoing success, we complete quarterly audits of HVAC and lighting schedules to ensure systems are going into setback modes during after-hour periods in both Caledonia, MI and also Lake Mary, FL buildings In Caledonia, we have implemented energy tracking and monitoring to help measure and manage utility consumption Over a year time period, electricity consumption is down by 14%

Our Caledonia, MI and Woodland Hills, CA offices participate in composting and compost approximately 10,400 pounds of food and coffee ground waste annually per site

In addition to these improvements, we have also implemented programs to remind employees to power down equipment when it is not in use  Many computer monitors and desktop computers are automatically set to go into a sleep or hibernation mode after a short period of inactivity

Depending on job assignment, employees may be provided with a company fleet vehicle  Since 2010, more fuel efficient vehicles have been purchased for the company fleet, mid-sized sedans are being used instead of full-size sedans, hybrid and electric vehicles have been added to the fleet and the overall fleet size has been reduced Over 485,000 less gallons of fuel were purchased (134% reduction) between 2017 and 2018

As many Farmers employees commute to our business locations, we encourage ridesharing and the use of public transportation  In some locations, we provide incentives including subsidies for train passes, bus passes and vanpools, free shuttle buses from train stations, and preferred carpool parking spaces  Farmers has also installed ten (8 in Southern California and 2 in Phoenix) electric charging stations to provide an energy source for those employees who already drive electric vehicles and to also encourage more environmentally friendly vehicle use In Los Angeles, we provide a company stipend to employees for alternative travel

Telepresence technology and high quality HD video conferencing systems in many operations have helped minimize airline travel

In addition to our focus on the reduction of emissions we have made improvements in our effort to reduce water consumption  Improvements include low volume sink faucets, low volume toilets, and waterless urinals  Other improvements within our operations include upgrades to programmable irrigation systems and pop-up sprinkler heads, which eliminate leakage and overspray  We have also transitioned to xeriscape in some locations

We continue to work on reducing utilization of paper and office supplies We have set an internal goal to reduce print for internal purposes by 80% and are implementing a variety of actions to help achieve this goal  Copier/printer machines in many of our locations are set for duplex (two-sided) printing and the print/copy default has been set to black and white vs color   Farmers has implemented an MDS optimization program within Document Logistics, replacing multi-functional devises with more energy efficient equipment This program was put into place not only to reduce energy consumption and the impact on the environment, but to also ensure cost savings We are in the fourth year of the program and continue to reduce both the number and size of the multifunction devices (MFD) in our facilities  Through year end 2018 we have reduced the number of multifunction devices (MFD) from 3,329 to slightly over 400 Replacement machines are right sized and more energy efficient

Virtually all employee communications are handled electronically rather than through paper  As of 2011, semi-monthly statements of employee earnings and deductions have been electronically available and are no longer printed and mailed to employees  Improved ordering processes have lowered the volume of consumable supplies in many locations  Recycling programs have been implemented for paper, plastic, cardboard and glass  Printer, copier ink and toner cartridges are also recycled, as are cell phones, chargers and obsolete electronic equipment such as computers and monitors  In our mail rooms, we have begun recycling and reusing packing materials for shipping

We have implemented initiatives that provide customers with environmentally friendly choices that also reduce the organizations carbon footprint For example, in some operations, mail sent to agents and customers is delivered in envelopes made of recycled material  A new billing system available in some states and for some products provides increased on-line billing and payment capabilities  In some states and for some products, we are working to provide customers with the option to receive electronic policy forms and notices from us, rather than paper copies  Customers with these electronic policies may also have the option to receive bills, pay bills, and view their billing histories online  Some states prohibit the use of paperless communication with policyholders, which limits our ability to consider paperless options

Our MultiCar auto policy, available in some states, can cover multiple vehicles on one policy, thereby reducing the amount of paper customers receive and our overall carbon footprint

In 2010, Farmers built a 164,000 SF facility in Oklahoma City that was recognized by the US Green Building Council as qualifying for Core and Shell LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) certification at the silver level, and also qualified for LEED certification for the Tenant Improvement portion of the project  1400 employees moved into the building in October 2010 and continue to work there today

In some of our larger facilities: 1) ice and water machines are provided, reducing plastic bottled water consumption; 2) programmable thermostats are in place; 3) carbon footprint studies and energy audits have been completed; 4) Energy Star equipment is purchased whenever practical; 5) cleaning hours were revised to allow for more daytime cleaning, allowing us to deactivate interior lights earlier in the evening; 6) new employees are informed of our green business practices during their initial training classes and existing employees receive regular electronic communications on various energy-related topics, keeping awareness at a high level 7) In 2016 our large facility in Washington started a composting program as part of its waste services in the café and all kitchenettes

We have also set a goal to eliminate single use plastic from our internal operations and are working with our vendors to implement this goal and replace single-use plastic materials with alternative, environmentally friendly materials
In 2018, Farmers also created a customer paperless campaign Farmers worked with American Forests, the countrys oldest nonprofit conservation group, to encourage customers to go paperless As a part of the campaign, in the month of September, as customers would switch to a paperless policy and/or paperless billing during, Farmers would donate $1 to plant one tree, up to $25,000

In addition the two Print and Distribution Centers in North America have implemented several significant initiatives to mitigate impacts to the environment including: aggressive approach to deliver agent, customer and broker documents electronically versus traditional USPS mail;  On-line report viewing; purchasing of envelopes and stationary manufactured with paper from trees harvested from forests that are SFI (Sustainable Forestry Initiative) certified, Print-On-Demand of agent support materials versus warehoused stored materials; digitizing as much in-bound mail as possible via an active imaging approach; implemented many initiatives improving efficiency, lowering energy consumption, actively participating in operational recycling program, consolidating operations to a  two-site COE model and reducing operational waste from 4% to less than 2%",0

We incorporate environmental factors in our decision making for asset allocation and screening for security selection for publicly listed common stocks and fixed income securities of corporate and municipal issuers  Our investment professionals employ both qualitative and quantitative screens of environmental factors to identify industry and company specific risks and opportunities  The findings from this process are then incorporated with the other relevant information we consider as part of our broader investment decision making

This awareness leads us to favor investments in companies with a demonstrated commitment toward a reduced carbon footprint and increased reliance on cleaner and or renewable energy sources  In addition, since climate change can affect weather patterns, our investment decision making recognizes that certain regions and parts of the country are more vulnerable to rising ocean levels, coastal flooding and storms, drought, wild fire and other natural disasters

We believe that a pro-active integration of relevant Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) factors into the investment process alongside traditional financial metrics and state-of-the-art risk management practices could support our investment result  However, integration of such factors requires diligence, expertise and focus  We do not believe that simply dedicating specific investment portfolios to the latest climate-branded product of the asset management industry creates sustainable value for our stakeholders and the environment

Our investments are primarily managed by third-party asset managers, and it is at this level that individual security selection decisions are made  These asset managers operate within agreed portfolio guidelines set by Farmers and take all aspects into account, both financial and non-financial, when managing Farmers individual portfolios to ensure maximum value creation 

As our core competency is selecting the right asset managers and evaluating them based on their superior investment processes, we have taken the following actions:

1) For the procurement of new asset managers, we include questions related to the inclusion of ESG factors in the investment process into our request for proposal (RFP)
2) We have implemented the capability to monitor ESG ratings provided by MSCI in our risk systems  This allows us to enter into a proactive dialogue with our asset managers about risk exposures to environmental factors",4

The Company has developed an internal capital model which measures the potential impact and correlation amongst underwriting, catastrophe, market, credit, and operational risks We have plans to enhance this model in the future with the use of common shock modeling, which may include certain climate change shocks Finally, the Company is in the process of implementing a stress testing framework to assess the economic impacts of climate risk",7

Metropolitan Tower Life Insurance Company," Through MetLifes Sustainability Program, the Company strives to lower energy consumption, mitigate GHG emissions and reduce the overall environmental impact of its global operations  The Companys environmental management efforts include awareness and education aimed to facilitate waste reduction, recycling and reuse initiatives; engage employees on environmental issues and healthy lifestyle choices; and work with suppliers to reduce environmental impacts

MetLifes GHG emissions reduction strategy is focused on energy efficiency and green energy purchasing for US owned-and-operated office facilities, as the Company achieves emissions reductions in other areas of its carbon footprint In 2005, MetLife established a goal to reduce indirect GHG emissions (Scope 2 emissions) 20% by 2010 (based on the 2005 baseline year) for all of the Companys US owned-and-operated office facilities This goal was achieved in 2009 Since then, MetLifes portfolio has annually achieved a total of zero Scope 2 emissions through renewable energy credit (REC) purchases As of end of the year 2014, MetLife has reduced energy consumption by 25% for the same portfolio of offices, as compared to the baseline year The energy reduction was realized through a combination of capital projects and facility upgrades focused on energy efficient Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) equipment, lighting, commissioning, water efficiency, and demand metering Continuing this significant progress, MetLife looks for new opportunities to reduce the Companys carbon footprint, address climate change, and invest in efforts that have a positive impact on the environment  In 2014, MetLife established two new public emissions reduction targets for the Companys US owned-and-operated office facilities: a 10% reduction in energy (kWh) consumption by the end of 2017 relative to a 2010 baseline year and continued achievement of zero Scope 2 GHG emissions annually, through the Companys REC purchasing strategies 

MetLife embeds environmental sustainability and emissions reduction programs into the Companys overall business strategy through green procurement practices and environmental certifications (eg, Energy Star, Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) etc) Recent initiatives include MetLifes participation in the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) Supply Chain Program, aimed at benchmarking and reducing value chain emissions MetLife also maintains focus on improving energy efficiency and reducing the environmental impact of the Companys data center operations In 2012, MetLifes Rensselaer Information Systems Center (RISC) data center in Troy, New York, was recognized as the first Energy Star-certified data center in New York State In 2014, the RISC the data center scored in the 98th percentile of existing building data centers As of 2015 there are fewer than 40 data centers with the Energy Star label and MetLife has one of the highest ranked data centers in the nation Efforts implemented to reduce RISCs environmental impacts included: installation of boiler system controls; upgraded lighting control panels; utilization of waterless technology; and implementation of virtualization technology to enable the facility to share resources and save energy, hardware, software licensing, and IT infrastructure maintenance costs

Swiss Re Life & Health America Inc.," We engage with policy makers at international and national levels, business leaders in the insurance industry and other sectors, multilateral organizations, NGOs, and others

Much of the work Swiss Re does at the policy-maker level around the globe on the climate change topic aims to encourage a better understanding of the need for action as well as how the insurance industry can contribute from the perspective of a provider of risk transfer, a risk manager and as an investor Swiss Re generally works to support actions to help move the debate in the right direction rather than giving support for specific pieces of legislation For example, in Europe, we have continued to raise awareness of the important role insurers play in mitigating climate risk through different interactions with policy makers This includes speaking at industry conferences (Insurance Europe and the ABI), presenting at the European Commissions DG Climate Actions working group on Climate Adaptation and engaging bilaterally with the European Commission and national governments In the US, we have maintained regular dialogue with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC), principally on climate change and natural catastrophes 

The RE100 group, of which Swiss Re is a founding member, approaches policy-makers and regulators at the national and sub-national level to make renewable energy more available, focusing eg on countries such as China, India, Brazil and South Africa over the next three years We helped establish Climate Groups RE100 initiative in 2014 to help make reneable energy more available The goal of this initiative is to unite the worlds most influential companies in a shared commitment to use 100% renewable power To achieve this, the group approaches policymakers and regulators at national and sub-national level to increase renewable energy availability RE100 grew substantially again in 2017 and now includes more than 120 of the worlds largest companies

In 2017, we helped develop the first parametric insurance solution for aquaculture in Taiwan, jointly with Taiwan Fire & Marine Insurance The programme will offer protection against extreme rainfall risk to 120 000 hectares of onshore fisheries in Ping Tung County, which together produce 25 million kilogrammes of grouper annually Grouper is one of the expensive fish breeds in Ping Tung County and represents a significant economic asset in Taiwans aquaculture industry As the 2009 typhoon season showed,however, fish ponds can suffer badly from extreme rainfall Flash floods due to typhoons caused many fish   ponds to overflow then, destroying nearly 50% of the fisheries in the process and causing large financial losses Using meteorological data, this innovative aquaculture insurance solution pays out automatically when there is rainfall of more than 480 mm for two consecutive days It is the second programme we have helped develop for the Taiwanese agricultural sector, in response to the governments initiative to transfer agricultural risks to re/insurers Allowing for quick payouts through its index-based trigger, the scheme helps to improve the sectors resilience It has attracted strong interest and demand from the fish farming community in Taiwan, and it is hoped that it will benefit further Asian countries in the future

Memberships of organizations such as The Climate Group allow for periodic dialogues on climate-related topics, (predominantly resilience and risk transfer themes) with regional, national and state governments which are also members In the area of resilience building, at the UN climate summit in September 2014, Swiss Re pledged its financial capacity as well as its expertise to help nations increase their climate resilience through the following commitment: ""By the year 2020, Swiss Re commits to having advised 50 sovereigns and sub-sovereigns on climate risk resilience, and to have offered them protection of USD 10bn against climate related risks""  We have agreed with the United Nations to report publicly on the progress we make on this commitment  By the end of 2017, we had advised 66 sovereigns and sub-sovereigns on climate risk resilience and offered them a total of USD 53 billion in re/insurance protection

Bankers considers modeled and historic loss trends to determine reinsurance structure and attachment/limit, and incorporates these factors into our risk management strategies  They are also used to determine levels of reinsurance and capital requirements to mete claims needs, pricing adequacy for catastrophic costs and to set guidelines to mitigate catastrophe exposures

Most catastrophe models today are approved by regulators and are generally developed using the latest weather and climate data and science, tested by metrological, engineering, computer science and actuarial experts  The models often create alterations that account for perils where they believe future losses may deviate substantially from historical trends, specifically for Hurricanes  In these cases, Bankers considers the potential impact on the catastrophe loss distributions shown by these models

Furthermore, Bankers also takes into consideration different assumptions of Hurricane frequency and severity to match both the historic and the potential future hazard trends to test the impact of climate change on loss distribution  In addition to assumption sets created by model vendors, Bankers models scenarios of past severe events to determine the impact of prior storms on the current portfolio  Finally, Bankers considers deterministic scenarios to identify the potential impact of a worst-case scenario across its portfolio  The results of these stress tests are evaluated when deciding the best risk management strategy for the company, reinsurance purchases and growth plans and projections

Property insurance is an annual product, therefore, pricing underwriting and reinsurance and risk management strategies must evolve over the course of the year to match the changing market and climate environment As such, Bankers considers our view of risk as informed by the catastrophe models, to represent the most up-to-date view of the current environment for catastrophe events that may impact the portfolio  Consequently, the effects of climate change are accounted for on an ongoing basis, as the potential effect become known",7

Indemnity Ins Co of North America," In terms of regulatory risks, air pollution limits, emission reporting obligations, and uncertainty surrounding new regulation could all pose a risk to the company As regulations on air pollution limits evolve to include GHGs, such as the Title V Clean Air Act in the United States, there is an increased risk to Chubb if clients cannot comply with the new regulations For example, as reported in the Chubb sponsored paper, Global Environmental Regulation: Big Demands, Bigger Challenges, fines up to $32,000 per violation can be levied for failing to collect data or report GHG emissions New emissions reporting obligations; and different regional emission reporting requirements, present an indirect risk to Chubb These various regulations have resulted in companies that are focused on reducing emissions and/or generating emission credits under the mechanisms created by said regulations These emission reducing/credit producing projects encompass an enormous variety of technologies, some proven, some more experimental Many of these projects are located in the developing world, and the regulatory and financial framework underpinning these projects continues to undergo rapid development As a result, these projects present a unique risk profile with heightened technical, political and financial risk, which Chubb assumes through its insurance products  Chubb is also among the largest and most advanced global underwriters of environmental liabilities and pollution risk, with Chubb Environmental Risk units in North America, Latin America, Europe and Asia Typical cover includes premises-based exposures, contractors and project pollution liability, professional liability, and an array of cover for environmental clean-up projects As part of the potential insureds evaluation process when seeking applicable environmental risk transfer products, Chubb considers emerging trends when finalizing contractual terms and conditions as well as pricing 

There are also indirect risks due to the fact that our company provides clients with insurance and reinsurance protection from the impact of natural catastrophes, including weather events that may become more frequent or severe due to climate change Specifically, related to precipitation extremes and droughts, the areas exposed are property and crop coverage, which collectively comprise a meaningful share of our net written premium annually The risk is that actual losses in a given year may exceed the underlying underwriting and actuarial assumptions used to price products, thereby eroding profitability and, in extreme circumstances, shareholder capital Also, radical changes in the frequency and/or severity of natural catastrophes, such as tropical cyclones, could jeopardize or potentially eliminate certain Chubb markets through physical damage, price escalation and/or regulatory activity In addition, changes in climatology or local weather patterns may generate unpredictable patterns in hurricanes/typhoons or severe localized events such as freezing, flooding, tornadoes or hail Such unpredictability could negate the use of actuarial techniques and undermine our ability to price and risk-manage price offerings As a global property and casualty insurer, Chubb is exposed to potential losses from various types of weather-related events In particular, natural catastrophe related losses are reported annually and as needed for extraordinary events or periods In 2017, Chubb recorded net pre-tax catastrophe losses of $27 billion compared with $11 billion in 2016 on an as if basis 

In Chubbs own operations, offices in strategically important locations could be affected by physical risks For example, Chubbs offices in New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania represent a concentration of regional operations in North America, with more than 6,000 employees and several of the companys senior executives Chubbs offices in Hamilton, Bermuda, are the headquarters for the companys Chubb Tempest Re and Chubb Bermuda subsidiaries, as well as several corporate executives The Singapore office serves as the headquarters for Chubbs 14-country Asia-Pacific region and houses several regional executives and a multi-country telemarketing operation Specifically, as precipitation patterns change and the severity and consistency of storms increases, there is an increased chance of flooding or snow accumulation that could affect Chubb employees by limiting their abilities to commute to the office or affect Chubb offices by causing power outages Chubb has developed a business continuity framework to respond to any incident, including those related to climate change, that may disrupt business operations, regardless of the size, scope or cause",3

Climate change risk currently ranks lower on the risk spectrum when compared to liquidity, durations, interest rate, and asset class

Furthermore from an investment portfolio standpoint we believe any risks or opportunities associated with climate change, such as carbon and water restrictions, are generally priced into the cost of the investment through the market; any potential arbitrage opportunities would have imbedded investment risk which we believe to be inappropriate for us to take given our overall risk tolerance profile

Given the nature of our underwritten liability we do not currently assess the correlation between climate risks our underwriting and investments Due to the relative short-tailed liability associated with the health underwriting risk profile we believe it is not as critical as it would be for a life company, or P&C company, to structure our portfolio with a similar duration

Swiss Re Life & Health America Inc.," Therefore, it is important that we also take a long-term view on the risk factors that may have an adverse impact on our portfolio, which includes climate change Hence, sustainability and climate change are essential topics for us Our asset management is committed to sustainability and has a well-defined framework which considers ESG criteria, consistently with the Groups Code of Conduct The overall responsibility for responsible investing lies with the Group Chief Investment Officer, supported by the Head Responsible Investing, the Asset Management Investment Committee and the Asset Management Executive Team Furthermore, an ESG Advisory Board, formed by representatives of all investment units, legal, compliance and risk management, reports on responsible investment activities in the various investment units, develops and reviews improvement ideas, shares knowledge and monitors implementation progress
The Group Asset Management Standard on Responsible Investments (our internal policy) defines our commitment to sustainability The document outlines the principles for all responsible investing activities which include asset classes, investment manager selection, portfolio monitoring and reporting, voting (through the reference to the Swiss Re Voting Framework) and engagement 
Swiss Re's strong commitment to sustainability is also defined in our Group-wide Sustainability Risk Framework This framework is applied to the entire investment portfolio, and enables us to identify and analyse potential ESG risks within an investment The framework consists of two umbrella policies on human rights and environmental protection, and seven policies on sensitive sectors or issues: the defence industry; oil and gas (including oil sands); mining; dams; animal testing; forestry and logging; pulp & paper and oil palm; and nuclear weapons proliferation Each policy contains a number of predefined criteria and qualitative standards that may lead to the exclusion of a company or a country from our investment scope Our Asset Management unit applies all mentioned criteria to our investment assets, and excludes companies and countries if they do not meet the pre-defined criteria and qualitative standards Our exclusion list is reviewed on a regular basis
As a long-term investor, we consider ESG criteria that may have an adverse impact on the sustainable value of our portfolio, such as climate risk and pollution & waste For the systematic and regular integration of such ESG criteria, we apply sustainability ratings to our investment portfolio Furthermore, based on Swiss Res commitment to support the transition to a low-carbon environment, we started to measure the weighted average carbon intensity  of our listed equities and credit portfolio since the end of 2015 
In 2017, Swiss Re's Asset Management received the highest rating for its responsible investment approach (""Strategy & Governance"") Swiss Re scores among the top 15% of all signatories of the United Nations' Principles for Responsible Investments 
ESG considerations per asset class: 
1) Government bonds
Our largest holding within rates products are government bonds (incl agency) At country level, we have implemented a concept of minimum ESG rating standards considering political risk, human rights, and environmental factors that affect the resilience of countries as part of our ESG practice Investments in government bonds hold an ESG rating of BB or better The detailed information is provided by a specialised research company Assessment results guide our responsible investment decisions to ensure the targeted ESG quality of our government bond portfolio This portfolio is screened against such ESG criteria considerations on a monthly basis The sustainability rating is of particular relevance from the perspective of climate change as it measures not only the overall social and governance situation in a country but also its environmental aspects This allows us to consider environmental management in any country in our investment strategy 

2) Credit products, listed equities, private equity and real estate
At the end of 2017, approximately 43% of our investment portfolio was managed externally This portfolio comprises mainly credit products, equities and hedge funds PRI signatories manage more than 95% of these assets We look at ESG integration primarily from the viewpoint of generating sustainable long-term returns, which aligns well with our focus on a high-quality investment portfolio As part of our active risk management, we are therefore adopting ESG-based benchmarks in our actively managed credit and listed equity portfolios Active credit mandates are benchmarked against Bloomberg Barclays MSCI Corporate Sustainability indices and listed equities are benchmarked against MSCI ACWI ESG Leaders indices, with portfolio managers assessed against outperformance as well as ESG quality of the portfolio
 
Furthermore, all of our external asset managers have contractual provisions with Swiss Re that specifically relate to responsible investing  
We work closely with the external managers to ensure they consider ESG aspects in their investment processes Before external managers are appointed, we perform thorough due diligence to confirm their compliance with our responsible investment principles This includes ESG considerations in investment decisions and monitoring, as well as a review of the managers commitment to responsible investing After being mandated, the managers individual performances are monitored in line with our Responsible Investment Policy and measured against ESG-related benchmarks The managers are required to report regularly on their responsible investment activities
For more systematic and regular monitoring of the actual integration of ESG criteria into our externally managed portfolio, we have engaged the services of a leading ESG research company We conduct in-depth assessments based on ratings provided by them on a regular basis to analyse the quality of the portfolio and to gain further insight into ESG risk exposures We assess the portfolio on the following criteria that are built-up by the factors mentioned below:

Environmental: Climate Change, Natural Resources Use, Waste Management and Environmental Opportunities;
Social: Human Capital, Product Safety, Social Opportunities;
Governance: Corporate Governance, Business Ethics, Government & Public Policy

Results are used to better understand the implications of incorporating ESG considerations into our investment decision-making process and to further improve the quality of our investment portfolio
In 2016, we started to divest from companies that generate 30% or more of their revenues from thermal coal mining or that use at least 30% thermal coal for power generation The decision was taken to mitigate the risk of coal related assets becoming devalued or stranded over the long-term The decision resulted in over USD 13 billion divestments and a significant decrease in carbon intensities in both the credit and the listed equity portfolios For more information, please see Swiss Re's Annual Report 2017, p 137f

 

Furthermore, we actively contribute to a low carbon economy by investing in the growing SSA (sovereigns, supranational and agencies) green bond market, primarily relying on ICMA's Green Bond Principles As part of our commitment to sustainability, we also invest in green bonds in our credit mandates, as well as renewables and social infrastructure in our infrastructure private debt mandates Debt raised through green bonds is used to finance environmental responsible projects that provide clear benefits from that perspective We are well advanced in meeting our investment target for green bonds of at least USD 15bn
Swiss Re is committed to act as an advocate of long-term investments in infrastructure, as reflected by collaborating with, and advising, the World Banks recently established Global Infrastructure Facility Infrastructure debt is an attractive asset class for a long-term investor like Swiss Re Improving energy efficiency and developing low-carbon technologies, including renewable energy sources, are critical to reducing carbon emissions and securing future energy supplies Renewables and social infrastructure investments are therefore the largest sub-sector in our infrastructure mandate The reporting refers to number of infrastructure projects:
 
Direct private equity investment professionals consider ESG issues when reviewing new Private Equity investment opportunities and are responsible to closely monitor the portfolio of direct private equity investments with respect to ESG issues They actively engage with the management team of the portfolio companies whenever it is deemed necessary in line with Swiss Re's duty as significant minority shareholder
New investments are only made into Private Equity funds that adhere to ESG guidelines and exclusion lists ESG considerations are systematically included to the Investment Memorandum ESG considerations at investee company level are reviewed and discussed as part of an annual deep dive analysis and meeting This includes an update on any changes based on discussions and information received from investee companies' management teams
In Swiss Re's real estate investments, sustainability criteria play an essential role We apply ambitious sustainability standards For projects in Switzerland, the applicable criteria are defined in the Energy Mission Statement of Swiss Re This stipulates that all new buildings need to conform to the MINERGIE standard (wwwminergiech), a Swiss quality label specifying high levels of energy efficiency and superior user comfort When an existing building is due for renovation, this standard applies whenever it is feasible from an architectural, technical and financial point of view In Q2 2018, the combined value of our MINERGIE®-certified buildings reached USD 04 billion, or 22% of our Swiss portfolio of direct real estate investments The total energy consumption surface in accordance with the MINERGIE® standard was 82'497 m2in Q2 2018 
Since 2015, Swiss Re has also invested in the US real estate market The investment managers approach to sustainability includes GreenGuide: Sustainable Property Operations, a best practice guideline for sustainable and efficient real estate operations; ULI GreenPrint Foundation, a global environmental management platform; and LEED Certification from the US Green Building Council The portfolio is also benchmarked against GRESB, a relative benchmark reliant on performance of all submitting entities

Kaiser Foundation Health Plan of Washington,"
The Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) concluded in 2013 that an increase in extreme weather events, coupled with the spread of infectious diseases, and food and water scarcity, are likely to present material implications for the managed care industry through an increase in covered medical expenses SASB also noted that an increase in the frequency of extreme weather events has the potential to impact costs and liabilities by generating additional covered medical expenses and that the associated risks could lead to an increased cost of capital Higher incidence of disease could negatively affect both clinical and non-clinical staff availability, resulting in higher expenditures on sick leave and backfilling The financial implications of these health-related impacts are difficult to quantify Changes in physical climate may also affect the efficiency of our facility operations, including increased power and water consumption necessary to maintain the indoor environment of our hospitals and patient care buildings
According to the US Global Change Research Programs published 2016 scientific assessment of the impacts of climate change on human health in the United States:
Current and future climate impacts expose more people in more places to public health threats Already in the United States, we have observed climate-related increases in our exposure to elevated temperatures; more frequent, severe, or longer-lasting extreme events; degraded air quality; diseases transmitted through food, water, and disease vectors (such as ticks and mosquitoes); and stresses to our mental health and well¬being Almost all of these threats are expected to worsen with continued climate change Some of these health threats will occur over longer time periods, or at unprecedented times of the year; some people will be exposed to threats not previously experienced in their locations Overall, instances of potentially beneficial health impacts of climate change are limited in number and pertain to specific regions or populations For example, the reduction in cold-related deaths is projected to be smaller than the increase in heat-related deaths in most regions Every American is vulnerable to the health impacts associated with climate change Increased exposure to multiple health threats, together with changes in sensitivity and the ability to adapt to those threats, increases a persons vulnerability to climate-related health effects The impacts of climate change on human health interact with underlying health, demographic, and socioeconomic factors Through the combined influence of these factors, climate change exacerbates some existing health threats and creates new public health challenges While all Americans are at risk, some populations are disproportionately vulnerable, including those with low income, some communities of color, immigrant groups (including those with limited English proficiency), Indigenous peoples, children and pregnant women, older adults, vulnerable occupational groups, persons with disabilities, and persons with preexisting or chronic medical conditions
In the April 4, 2013 edition of the New England Journal of Medicine, McMichael identifies three categories of climate-change risks to health, along with their causal pathway:
1	Primary: Direct biologic consequences of heat waves, extreme weather events, and temperature-enhanced levels of urban air pollutants;
2	Secondary: Risks mediated by changes in biophysically and ecologically based processes and systems, particularly food yields, water flows, infectious-disease vectors, and (for zoonotic diseases) intermediate-host ecology; and
3	Tertiary: More diffuse effects (eg, mental health problems in failing farm communities, displaced groups, disadvantaged indigenous and minority ethnic groups); consequences of tension and conflict owing to climate changerelated declines in basic resources (water, food, timber, living space)
With regard to primary risks, climate change directly impacts the populations in all geographical areas that KP serves While all regions in which KP operates are at risk of illnesses and loss of life due to extreme temperatures, the specific risk exposures may vary For example, while the Northern and Southern California regions are particularly affected by droughts, wildfires and heat waves, the Mid-Atlantic States and Georgia are more prone to severe storms and storm surges Hawaii and the Pacific Northwest are relatively more exposed to coastal flooding as well as heat waves In general, global warming can aggravate the effects of pre-existing health conditions such as chronic respiratory disease and asthma, due to increases in air pollutants and aeroallergens There is evidence of declining air quality in cities since greater heat can also worsen air pollution such as ground-level ozone or smog According to the National Center for Health Statistics, overall current asthma prevalence among adults increased from 20012002 (71%) to 20132014 (92%) By weight status, prevalence increased among overweight adults but not among adults in the obese or normal weight categories

With regard to secondary risks, climate-related disturbances in ecological systems, such as changes in the range of infective parasites, can increase the incidence of serious infectious diseases The tick that carries Lyme Disease is reported in 457% of US counties, up from 30% in 19983 Other secondary health effects of global warming include water- and food-borne diseases Warm temperatures also increase water pollution which harms human health In rural areas, increased food insecurity can occur due to geographical shifts in optimum growing conditions and decreases in crop yields; reduced water resources for agriculture and for human consumption; and loss of property such as cropland because of floods, droughts and a rise in sea level
With regard to tertiary risks, according to The Medical Society Consortium on Climate and Health: Many people exposed to the worst extreme weather events experience stress and serious mental health consequences including depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and increases in suicidal thoughts and behavior Such disasters are also associated with increases in alcohol or drug abuse Children may also experience prolonged separation from their parents Beyond the well-known risks specific disasters pose to our mental health, the physical, social, and economic stresses created by climate change all increase our risk of mental health problems

Kaiser Foundation Health Plan of Washington," KPs current and planned efforts to reduce its overall greenhouse gas emissions include energy conservation initiatives as well as large-scale investments in renewable energy sources and the purchase of carbon offsets For example, in the State of Washington, KP has a Power Purchase Agreement with Puget Sound Energy that, starting in 2021, supplies 100% of its yearly electricity needs from wind energy KP continuously conducts baseline and performance measurements for energy consumption and other sources of greenhouse gas emissions across its facilities and activities under its operational control These include clinical buildings where health care is delivered as well as non-clinical buildings (for activities such as administration and data storage) and fleet vehicle operations KP annually measures and reports its greenhouse gas emissions based on the General Reporting Protocol of The Climate Registry, a nonprofit collaboration among North American states, provinces, territories and Native Sovereign Nations that sets standards to calculate, verify and publicly report greenhouse gas emissionsKP publishes detailed summaries of its programs on its web site: wwwkporg/green",0
Group Health Cooperative," However, some of our external investment managers are thinking about its impact on investments through their traditional credit analysis and investment portfolio methods Those methods emphasize portfolio diversification across industries and issuers, and each security is evaluated on a case by case basis These policy characteristics are intended to mitigate the risk of any issuer or industry representing a disproportionate risk to the portfolio Climate change is a great importance to several industries, and at this time is most effectively evaluated in the context of a particular group",4
Farmers Insurance Company of Arizona,"  Regulatory risks as diverse as insurance regulatory obligations, emissions caps, base load management requirements, and building code requirements could impact the insurance business  Regulation, as well, can have the unintended consequence of masking risk based price signals and could cause stakeholders to increase climate related risk  rather than manage and reduce such risks  For example, subsidizing property insurance premiums, or flood insurance premiums or providing insurance or agreements to re-build in regularly eroded coastal locations or high risk fire areas could cause increase of building in such locations in a manner economically inconsistent with the physical risks presented by climate change
Regulatory uncertainty and regulation that is not economically well-grounded can create additional risk for both insurers and society  Even where public policies are well grounded in sound economic policy, multi-state and nationally active insurers will likely be required to address potentially disparate and conflicting climate policies and rules and bear the associated costs
 
These generally complex issues involving the interplay of new requirements within existing legal structures create unique risks; results of the same public policy will likely be different when applied in different jurisdictions - unless the results of interplay are completely and accurately analyzed in the development of such policy

Potential unintended negative consequences of regulatory action could pose a challenge for the industry, such as where the true economic cost of new legislation has not been well thought through or where the new legislation results in a disproportionate allocation of costs of climate related risk  In addition, competing requirements could mean that compliance in one jurisdiction may not satisfy other jurisdictions, thus creating duplicative or additive expenditures in the development of adaptive risk management solutions without demonstrable economic or social benefit  Additionally, regulatory actions may restrict a company from making needed changes to its pricing or prompt litigation which could put a financial strain on the organization

As the insurance industry faces regulatory risk, they face legal risk as well  Climate-related legislation that is not well-crafted may create incentives for lawsuits in some jurisdictions  Even in the absence of new laws, there have already been and may continue to be attempts to use existing laws to bring more climate change-related litigation against sovereign entities and companies in particular sectors

With respect to an insurers own operations and physical facilities, regulatory initiatives relating to emissions limits, transportation, water and energy use could impact office planning, employee commuting patterns and general resource usage  Within Farmers, activities to help respond to these trends have begun, including telecommuting, meetings held via phone, video and webinar, recycling and other environmentally-friendly practices

Farmers also has exposure to physical risks of climate change with respect to its own operations and as a result of exposures of its insureds assumed by Farmers though insurance policies  As outlined in the previous section, the physical risks impacting Farmers customers, as a result of climate change, may generate higher volatility in claims

A growing consensus among climate change experts suggests that changing weather patterns present risks of concern related to climate change  Direct impacts such as increased frequency and severity of precipitation events, droughts, and wildfire are among the multiplicity of potential conditions that could impact ultimate loss events for insureds  The risk of these events could also pose a financial strain on the organization  Improved resilience and customers risk management actions continue to be significant foci of Farmers  The potential indirect physical and public health impact, such as increased frequency of widespread disease events and localized food and water shortages, may also affect many areas of property and casualty insurance  Such physical risks have both obvious and subtle consequences for insurers  These vulnerabilities, risks, and consequences are considered as an integrated part of the underwriting process in a manner appropriate given the tenor of the insurance instrument and the manifestation of variability, risk management vulnerability reductions and impacts

With regard to the insurers' own operations or investments, insurers, like their customers, have facilities and operations that are exposed to physical risks of climate change described above  Climate change (severe drought) may drive people/employees away from California, which could be damaging to a Southern California based company

Alterra Excess and Surplus Insurance Company,  This includes premium discounts for those insureds that implement and maintain loss control measures,5
"Cariten Health Plan, Inc.","  If this were to happen, it could lead to increased incidences of chronic illnesses and in the type of clinical services Humana will need to offer its members For example, ""The Impacts of Climate Change on Human Health in the United States: A Scientific Assessment"" published by the US Global Change Research Program notes that climate change is already resulting in significant public health impacts which will continue to worsen if greenhouse gas emissions are not addressed

If Humana did not prepare for changes in physical climate, it is possible that Humana could suffer a loss in market share due to lack of readiness as well as increased operational costs associated with more health-related claims being filed   It is difficult to assess the financial impacts of these risks given the complexity of climate change and population health, however we do not currently anticipate substantial bottom line impacts

Climate change risks may also affect Humanas premium pricing, and therefore projected revenues associated with our services  Pricing and revenues are sensitive to several factors that may be impacted by climate change, including catastrophes or extreme weather events including public health epidemics or severe weather (eg hurricanes)  We continually review estimates of future payments relating to benefit claims costs for services incurred and make necessary adjustments to our reserves, including premium deficiency reserves where appropriate However, these estimates involve extensive judgment, and have considerable inherent variability that is sensitive to claim payment patterns and medical cost trends Senior level management will review pertinent information and have the ultimate authority to recommend changes in services offered and cost structures related to shifts in claims filed, or other company procedures in order to reduce impacts from these changes in customer claims and health trends related to changes in climate  The results of our partner dialogues and regional trending will inform future decisions around services offered to mitigate these impacts

Risks driven by changes in regulation

The financial risks resulting from an increase in operational and capital costs due to climate change-related regulations are considered to have a low magnitude of impact because energy expenditures represent less than 01% of Humanas total $495 billion operating budget Though operating expense increases due to energy taxes and regulations would have a material impact on budgetary costs, the overall operational cost impact for the portfolio would be minimal

Humana's Workplace Solutions team continuously evaluates short term and long term regulatory risks around energy and carbon A combination of forecasted energy costs due to general commodity price pressures, taxes and regulations or other impact is evaluated by the team to manage evolving financial exposure to energy prices In order to curb projected increases, the team works to budget for cost and environmental impact mitigation efforts such as energy efficiency projects to manage this risk This resulted in the formulation of an aggressive energy and carbon reduction target for the portfolio in efforts to manage operating costs and reduce Humana's environmental impacts

Risks driven by changes in physical climate parameters 

Increases in average temperature could result in more cooling degree days for Humana's data centers which could increase cooling loads at these and other locations

Any rise in average temperature that results in more cooling degree days throughout the year could increase cooling costs at Humana facilities, and in particular the company's data centers  Based on peer-reviewed research published in 2014, Humana has estimated the cost implications of rising data center energy consumption due to an increase in cooling degree days The potential aggregate estimated cost increase from 2015-2030 is $668,000, which is less than 01% of Humanas $7,525 million operating costs in 2018

Humana has worked with its equipment partners, done extensive modelling of air flow and cooling loads, and is implementing optimization strategies to minimize the cost of cooling and reduce the temperature differential required, while maintaining the reliability and performance of its data center equipment  For example, our IT and Facilities Management teams collaborated to install new building management systems (BMS) at the data centers These systems provide visibility into energy efficiency opportunities such as upgrades to lithium batteries and the addition of smart tiles to enhance the BMS system by monitoring air flows not just at the cabinet level, but also at the overall level 

While Humana does not have a direct cost associated with managing cooling degree days, past and ongoing investment in data center energy efficiency mitigates the risk by reducing overall energy consumption For example, Humana continues to use modeling software and tools purchased prior to the reporting period to optimize air flow and cooling needs In 2018, the hardware for the Tridium BMS system cost $25,000; funding came from the HUM Workplace Solutions Facilities Management team capital budget and the Facilities Management vendor managed the work

Significant weather events could also negatively impact our business by disrupting regular operations and limiting accessibility for our employees as well as our members Our Florida, Puerto Rico, and Texas operations in particular are located in areas that often experience severe storms As our data centers have disaster recovery methods in place to manage for risks unrelated to climate change, the estimated financial implications of this type of service disruption are considered to be low We relocated our recovery systems to Kentucky as a direct result of the lessons learned from Hurricane Maria, supporting our efforts to mitigate against hurricanes and other weather events, for which the financial implications are difficult to assess

To decrease the potential of business interruption due to a significant weather event, Humana's data centers maintain two separate power inputs, from different grids The centers also maintain a robust generator system that can provide power for 3-5 days before requiring re-fueling, while fuel service is contracted for a priority refill if requested Dual cooling systems are also in place Data center exterior walls were built to exceed ""tornado-level"" winds of over 100 mph, and both data centers are built on land not susceptible to flooding Humana maintains a secondary data center to support disaster recovery of technical systems In addition to our facility-specific management methods, Humana also has a robust work at home program, allowing staff to work remotely should there be an instance of reduced accessibility/pandemic or other issue The management methods described, including the data center specifications, our Business Continuity Program, and our work at home program, are considered to be routine operations for Humana to manage for several risks and opportunities in addition to the potential effects of climate change

Balboa Life Insurance Company,"  is headquartered in downtown St Paul, MN In 2009, Securians 401 Building was the first commercial office building in the St Paul and Minneapolis central business districts to earn the impressive LEED certification for Existing Buildings LEED certification is the most rigorous  and most difficult  standard of achievement, given only to the worlds greenest, energy efficient, high performing buildings 

In 2010, Securian received the Sustainable St Paul Award in 2010 for protecting and restoring the environment in the city Our sustainable practices include: 

	Cleaning products and processes that comply with strict environmental and safety standards, sanitizing our buildings to protect health without affecting indoor air quality or harming the environment 
	A combination of smart and manual lighting controls for optimal energy effectiveness 
	Optimizing hardware configuration, monitoring electrical consumption and using energy efficient methods to heat and cool servers 
	Heating and cooling our downtown campus with a locally produced, renewable energy source 
	Extensive material recycling and reclamation programs, from paper and plastic to kitchen grease Office-grade paper is shredded by a secure recycler, pulped and reprocessed 
	Participating in equipment recycling programs to keep obsolete or toxic equipment out of landfills 

Securian also supports sustainable commuting by providing: 

	Bike racks and showers provided for associates and tenants who bike to work 
	Discounted bus passes for associates 
	Vanpool Commuter Check payroll deduction program 

Securian encourages its associates to: 

	Reduce paper waste by printing on both sides of the paper and using electronic forms or PDF files when sharing documents 
	Turn off supplemental lighting when away from desk and switch off the lights in conference rooms 


Finally, Securian purchases heating and cooling services from District Energy St Paul (DESP), the largest hot water district heating system in the United States, which leads the industry in technology integration targeted to improve the efficiency and environmental profile of the system and its users   Highlights of DESPs services are:

	In its 30 years of operation, DESPs heating system operates at twice the efficiency of the former steam district heating system while using the same amount of fuel  
	Carbon emissions for the overall system have been cut in half, while the system size has almost tripled  A major component of this efficiency is the incorporation of combined heat and power as the primary heat provider to the system  This has also allowed the incorporation of approximately 250,000 tons of biomass each year, sourced from local wood residues and forestry residuals  This has resulted in significant carbon reductions per unit of energy for each customer  
	The profile of the energy from the combined heat and power facility is 1984 tons/MWhr and DESPs 2014 goal is to reach 0185 tons/MWhr
	The integration of combined heat and power for the system allows two energy products (heat and electricity) to be generated from a single source, increasing fuel efficiency, reducing costs for end users, and reducing carbon profiles in both energy sectors  
	The combined heat and power plant has also reduced sulfur dioxide and particulate emissions, carbon dioxide emissions, and the use of oil, natural gas and coal 
	In 2010, DESP also integrated the nations largest solar hot water installation  The carbon footprint from the high-performance solar thermal installation resulted in carbon emission reductions of approximately 460,000 pounds in 2012  
	DESPs cooling system has also reduced the customers environmental profile  The integration of district cooling significantly reduced the use of chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) refrigerants in customer buildings and has reduced peak electricity usage through the incorporation of thermal storage
	DESPs system utilizes a fiber optic meter data collection system that is one of the most advanced in the industry  This system provides DESP with data to enable its acclaimed customer service team to help optimize building performance and provides customers with increased information to manage their building performance to meet or exceed efficiency standards

LM Insurance Corporation,"  Through its efforts, Liberty Mutual has earned LEED certification for seven buildings and ENERGY STAR labels for eight buildings 

To meet the guidelines for these standards, the company applies a wide range of energy efficiency strategies including the addition of energy-efficient bulbs that use under one watt of energy per square foot, automatic flush toilets and automatic water spouts, lighting control systems that turn lights off after business hours in all common hallways, and occupancy sensors that control lights in offices and conference rooms  

Liberty Mutuals focus on energy reduction initiatives is ongoing and with a continued strong focus on implementing building operating best practices, the company continues to drive down its overall energy consumption across its owned building portfolio    

As it builds new and retro-fits existing buildings to LEED standards, Liberty Mutual mandates that all construction contractors on its work sites follow indoor air quality guidelines and practices  Examples include using recycled/recyclable carpet, low VOC (volatile organic compounds) adhesives, sealants, and paints  Liberty Mutuals new 22-story Boston office building was designed to be more energy efficient than a typical large modern office building and has achieved LEED Silver certification 

The company also looks for small changes that will make a big long-term impact  Activities such as working with contracted cleaning companies to ensure they follow environmentally-friendly procedures such as recycling plastic cleaning product containers and having the cleaners change from mops to microfiber products to use fewer chemicals in the cleaning process  

Because as an insurance company Liberty Mutual produces large amounts of paperwork, the companys Records Management department works closely with Liberty Mutuals record storage vendor to shred and recycle files eligible for destruction  Through its secure shredding program, in 2014 Liberty Mutual recycled 3,359 short tons of paper, which were transported to paper mills for pulping resulting in the following eco-friendly results: 470,302 pounds of CO2 avoided, 56,368 trees saved, and approximately 16,796 cubic yards of landfill space conserved  Furthering its office supply recycling initiative, Liberty Mutual continued its company-wide campaign to use recycled paper, which saved the equivalent of 8,800 trees

Liberty Mutual has also taken a leadership role in establishing compliance with office supply order minimums, which cut down on emissions by reducing the number of deliveries required to service its account 

Together in 2014, the secure shredding and office supply minimum initiatives saved 92,081,854 gallons of water, 7,592,025 electricity KW hours, and prevented 4,864,270 pounds of CO2

Liberty Mutuals PrintSmart Program resulted in a reduction of 11 million pages printed (compared to 2013), conserving 75M gallons of water and reducing CO2 emissions by 1,057 tons  In 2014, 82% of all Liberty Mutual marketing collateral was printed on demand  with preferred printing partners or downloaded to a desktop  If users choose to print, systems route the order to the closest print facility based on the ship-to zip code, resulting in faster delivery and reduced freight travel distance, thereby lowering carbon emissions  

Extending energy conservation beyond the office, over 98% of the companys automotive fleet consists of PZEV (partial zero emission vehicle) and flex-fuel vehicles  In 2014, the company reduced its fleet by 12%, reduced business miles driven by 9%, and transitioned 6% of its fleet from 6 to 4 cylinder vehicles  These changes to the vehicle program resulted in a positive impact of 23158 tons of CHG saved in the same period from 2013 to 2014 

Liberty Mutual has received numerous awards for its sustainability practices including: 
	2015 Champions of the Environment Award from the New York City College of Technology Foundation
	2014 Preservation Achievement Award from the Boston Preservation Alliance

Renewable Energy Generation:
Munich Re Group is one of the initiators of the Dii Initiative, aimed at establishing an energy infrastruc-ture in the EUMENA region supplying the Middle East/North Africa/Europe with renewable energy (RE) The initiative was established 2009 for three years Diis shareholders, including Munich Re, agreed in 2012 that Dii will be extended for two years until the end of 2014 As of August 2013, more than 30 people work at the Dii head office in Munich (Germany) and in its branches in Rabat (Moroc-co), Tunis (Tunisia) and Berlin (Germany) As shareholder Munich Re is member of the Dii Steering Operating Committee and participates in several working groups In addition MR supports different events, one example: Dr Torsten Jeworrek, Member of Munich Re Board, supported the annual meet-ing in Berlin in November 2012 with a key note speech highlighting the urgent need for new social and economic partnerships between Europe and its neighbors and the opportunities in the energy market The main goals of the Dii GmbH are:
1 Improving the electricity supply from renewables in MENA countries,
2 Developing a connected EU-MENA electricity market based on renewable energy technolo-gies; consequently, a supply of Europe with 10-20% of electricity from RE from the deserts in MENA by 2050 is expected based on Dii studies (see below)
The basic objectives are the creation of a positive investment climate (development of the technologi-cal, economic, political and regulatory framework), the initiation of selected reference projects, and the development of a long-term implementation concept by the year 2050 In June 2012 Desert Power 2050 was published focusing on mutual benefits for Europe and MENA from renewable energy de-ployment in the MENA region, demonstrating that a power system based on more than 90% of renew-able energy is technically possible and economically viable The second part of this publication, Get-ting Started, has been launched at a high-level Policy Conference of the EU Sustainable Energy Week organized by Dii in June 2013 The study provides the pathway towards an interconnected en-ergy system This implementation roadmap is crucial as it provides policy recommendations and fi-nancial/business case approaches for developing the renewable energy market in the MENA region in the coming decades
Adaptation Resiliency:
Munich Climate Insurance Initiative (MCII) was initiated by Munich Re Group in April 2005, bringing together representatives from insurance, the World Bank, NGOs and science in response to the grow-ing realization that insurance solutions plays a role in adaptation to climate change The initiative is based at the United Nations University Institute for Environment and Human Security (UNU-EHS) MCII has been involved in the United Nations climate negotiations process since 2005 and many of the main concepts have been included in post-Kyoto-Protocol negotiation texts and carried forward in-to the Work Programme on Loss and Damage under the Subsidiary Body for Implementation (SBI) of the UNFCCC Concrete examples of adaptation resiliency: Since 2011, MCII has been conducting the Climate Risk Adaptation and Insurance in the Caribbean project Initial funding has been provided by the German Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety (BMU) under the International Climate Initiative The project seeks to increase social resilience against ex-treme weather events by developing and implementing insurance solutions in three Caribbean coun-tries Since then two parametric weather-index based insurance solutions have been developed One product (Livelihood Protection Policy) is aimed at improving the financial protection of individuals in case of extreme weather events In May 2013 the Livelihood Protection Policy has been launched in St Lucia The insurance is designed in such a way as to offer incentives for reducing risks At the same time, the premium is so low that it is affordable for poor people The payment of benefits is triggered directly whenever a previously specified amount of rainfall or a wind-speed threshold is exceed-ed The other weather-index based insurance solutions targets lending institutions and provides a hedge against increased loan default after extreme weather events (Loan Portfolio Cover) This pro-ject is a first operative step of MCII in promoting integral risk management solutions for climate change adaptation in developing countries
Munich Reinsurance America, American Modern and HSB are members of the Insurance Institute for Business & Home Safety (IBHS) an organization, wholly supported by the property (re)insurance in-dustry, which conducts objective, scientific research to identify and promote effective actions that strengthen homes, businesses, and communities against natural disasters and other causes of loss IBHS does this by identifying and advocating improved property design, construction, retrofitting, maintenance, repair, and preparation practices IBHS guidance for mitigating property losses is avail-able directly to the public and to its members/policyholders
IBHS advocates the concept of going green and building strong recognizing that addressing climate change involves both reducing greenhouse gas emissions and adapting homes, businesses, and communities to severe weather that may result from climate change:
¿ As an insurance-supported organization, IBHS recognizes that climate change strategies must do more than build structures to be energy efficient They must be built to modern fire protection standards to help resist fire and avoid the water/chemical deluge needed for fire suppression; they should be strong enough to avoid wind destruction and resulting relocation in landfills; and proper-ties should be sited and elevated in a manner that protects against flooding and environmental degradation from landslides All of these are part of going green
¿ IBHS also firmly believes that adaptation is critical, not only to reduce long-term property insurance losses, but to buttress individual and societal resilience All of the property protection measures that IBHS advocates to strengthen structures against current weather threats will also reduce fu-ture losses caused by climate change events And, the unprecedented scientific research con-ducted at the unique IBHS Research Center is critical to identification of new mitigation actions that may help protect against more severe weather events
¿ Additionally, research conducted by IBHS will help to make sure that green building enhance-ments do not inadvertently cause structures to be less disaster-resistant, or even worse, threaten the life safety of occupants or first respondersfor example, photovoltaic arrays that take flight or pose fire suppression challenges are the antithesis of building strong
As a building science institute, IBHS research helps its member companies to better understand struc-tural vulnerability and the role that mitigation plays in reducing damage from severe weather, as well as what mitigation features to look for when inspecting a residential or commercial building
A few states (Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, and South Carolina) have developed legislative or regulatory discount frameworks for homes built or retrofitted to the code-plus, hazard-specific FORTIFIED new construction and retrofit standards developed by IBHS In these states, the Institute has worked with insurance regulators and insurance companies to make sure that the dis-count programs work as they were intended upon enactment, and actually facilitate risk-based pricing, which can serve both to encourage effective mitigation and discourage unsound development in dis-aster-prone areas In addition to discounts, insurance incentives related to mitigation may include a positive decision by an underwriter to provide coverage in the voluntary, rather than through the resid-ual, market, lower deductibles, or more favorable coverage terms relating to post-disaster claims payments",6

Energy efficiency has always been an important area of focus for The Hanover More than 20 years ago, The Hanover began a journey to reduce its electrical consumption From an investment in ultra-efficient ice harvesting thermal storage technology for cooling its buildings, to upgrading building fan systems with high efficiency variable speed drive motors, installing continuous commissioning energy management systems, replacing much of its florescent lighting with efficient LED lighting, and the installation of white roofs on buildings to lower heating and cooling requirements, The Hanover has worked tirelessly to reduce its energy consumption The culmination of these and other energy conservation projects resulted in the achievement of the prestigious EPA Energy Star certification for the seventh consecutive year for The Hanover owned properties This certification affirms top quartile performance in energy usage according to EPA guidelines In addition, for the past six consecutive years, 100% of the electricity consumed on The Hanovers 800K square foot Worcester headquarters campus is offset by purchasing certified Renewable Energy Certificates This commitment equates to over 80% of the entire electricity demand across The Hanovers 14M square foot office portfolio 

The company also established a leadership position in the area of environmental responsibility For almost 15 years, The Hanover has worked diligently to strengthen its Green Cleaning program This program improves indoor air quality, reduces water consumption and energy usage, and utilizes cleaning products that have minimal impact to the waste stream The Hanover also takes pride in its innovative and robust recycling programs, where in 2015, our headquarters office recycling efforts included: 122 tons of mixed fiber, cans, plastic and glass recycled; 34 tons of composted material; 25 tons of electronics; and 39 tons construction and demolition material In total, these recycling efforts successfully diverted in excess of 44% of the total waste stream away from landfills  

The Hanover recognizes the impact its employees have on the environment as well, as they commute to and from work With this in mind, The Hanover supports the use of alternate forms of travel to reduce Greenhouse Gas emissions At its headquarters offices in Worcester, The Hanover has partnered with Mass-Rides, a ride-matching service sponsored by the Massachusetts Department of Transportation, which rewards employees for walking, biking, telecommuting, carpooling, vanpooling, taking transit, or working a compressed week With the recognition that electric cars materially contribute to the reduction of carbon emissions and a healthier planet, we have invested in electric car charging stations for employees and visitors at our Worcester headquarters With Massachusetts anticipating that 300,000 electric vehicles will be on the road by 2025, we are proud to help pave the way for widespread use of alternative fuel vehicles  The Hanover also supports employee flexible work schedules which allow many employees to work from home, further improving air quality and reducing traffic on our roadways For these efforts, The Hanover has earned the ECO leadership award from Massachusetts Department of Transportation 

Beyond the measurable results above, each year The Hanover hosts an Employee Earth Day Celebration to educate and showcase its commitment to energy efficiency and environmental conservation This much-anticipated event includes booths and presentations by internal groups, vendors and other exhibitors that invest their time and energy to make ours a more energy efficient, green-friendly planet Employees are encouraged to attend the event, visit with the exhibitors, learn and become an active participant in reducing their carbon footprint not only at The Hanover, but in their everyday lives 

All of these efforts have a significant impact on our organization Most importantly, our sustainability program makes a meaningful impact to reduce The Hanovers carbon footprint Secondly, weve seen material energy savings and utility cost savings as a result of our efforts Finally, as we continue to strive to recruit the best talent in the industry, our sustainability practices have helped us attract more environmentally-conscious employees, especially early-in-career talent, who view sustainability efforts as part of their criteria for job opportunities

Victoria Automobile Insurance Company,"S Nationwide Mutual and its subsidiaries write personal, agribusiness, main-street and middle-market commercial property casualty insurance, as well as life insurance and retirement solution products Nationwide stays abreast of the most recent scientific studies and findings with regard to climate change Currently, the consensus opinion by the scientific community on observed trends is that tropical cyclones, extropical cyclones (winter storms), and severe thunderstorms will increase in intensity while decreasing in frequency due to climate change Wildfires and floods are expected to increase in both intensity and frequency

The Nationwide companies face several potential business risks associated with climate change including:

Potential volatility in results due to possible increased frequency and/or severity of weather-related catastrophic losses;

Regulatory constraints on charging appropriate rates that take into account possible weather changes and related losses that are not reflected by historical statistics; 

Market share of business being adversely impacted due to a disproportionate growth of population and property along coastal areas; 

Catastrophic losses not limited to coastal areas potentially becoming more frequent (as in hurricane-related losses in the Midwest);

Disparate impact of climate change on certain insured segments either directly (such as agriculture), or through regulation (eg heavy industry due to emissions) These insured segments could be significantly impacted which could in turn affect the companys business and 

Availability and cost of risk transfer options (Reinsurance, Cat Bonds, Cat Swaps, etc)

As we go to market with different initiatives, geographic diversification is one of the factors taken into consideration Additionally, Nationwide maintains sizable investment portfolios which might be impacted by climate change Therefore, consideration is given to the potential impacts of climate change on the investment portfolio

As many of these risks cross boundaries, the risk assessment needs to consider the correlation of the risk across the entire enterprise

Potentially Impacted Geographies: Nationwide companies have property exposures in all 50 states and the District of Columbia and the entire geography is subject to some potential consequence of climate change Nationwides Life and Retirement Solutions exposures also include all 50 states and the District of Columbia

Universal Underwriters of Texas Insurance Compan," It includes climate-related perils, such as tropical cyclones, extra-tropical cyclones, floods and severe convective storms The model is not purely relying on a single model vendor (eg Risk Management Solutions Inc) but has the flexibility to use any vendor model's output and implement proprietary adjustments to both the severity and frequency of events to reflect the 'Zurich View' of risk Zurich aims to understand the assumptions in the models, gain a multi-model view, compare to claims experience and use internal and external insight

The time scale of the changes projected is typically over a period of several decades In the catastrophe accumulation processes Zurich is continuously adjusting to actual developments over time in a manner appropriate for the instruments modeled Catastrophe models typically are updated every five years Zurich considers the impact of climate change on a five year time horizon to be smaller than the impact of the natural climate variability (eg ENSO, AMO) and the general variability of catastrophe events

Zurich monitors emerging climate research through internal expertise and gains external insight through the Advisory Committee for Catastrophes, which is made up of world-class scientists, including an author from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 

The requirement for a Zurich View of risk is contained within Zurichs Risk and Underwriting policies and is governed through the Head of Group  Underwriting Excellence , the Head of Group Reinsurance and the Cat Technical Expert Group The work Zurich has done on its view of risk has in some cases led to vendor model change The model, which has grown from its initial platform developed in 2004, has been approved by the Swiss regulator, FINMA, for use under the Swiss Solvency Test as well as by the Central Bank of Ireland for use under the Solvency II regulation

When Zurich globalized Cat Management within its Underwriting area in 2010, a dedicated new function 'Cat Research & Development' was established The purpose of this function is to establish the Zurich View of risk by validating and calibrating the existing risk models and including the newest available scientific insights

Insurance Company of Greater Nerw  York," GNY writes the following lines of business: Property, General Liability, Commercial Auto, Workers Compensation, and Umbrella, with the majority of exposures written in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Illinois The Property line is the largest line of business in the company and is directly impacted by weather resulting from climate change The major perils that would impact GNY are: coastal wind from tropical storms, interior wind caused by tornado, hail and convective storms, flood, storm surge, excessive heat, drought, lightning, winter storms, and brownouts or blackouts Growth in frequency and severity of these perils is expected to increase due to both a changing climate and a growing population, particularly along the coasts and in the larger urban metropolitan cities where we write much of our business For many years, GNY has successfully executed a diversification strategy that expands the geographic footprint of written exposures An additional strategy is that GNY purchases treaty reinsurance from highly-rated reinsurers on both a risk and catastrophe basis in order to spread the risk and lessen the volatility that climate change and changing weather may bring As a company, GNY looks to mitigate the impact of climate change by recycling, sending policies electronically, transitioning to a paperless environment by using electronic imaging systems, and by encouraging public transportation or carpooling GNY continually monitors, assesses, and responds to risks and opportunities posed by climate change while balancing the need to meet our insureds requirements and achieving a financially-stable and long-term position in the marketplace for our insureds and our Company",3
Nationwide Insurance Company of Florida," A robust Enterprise Risk Management program identifies potential risks and develops controls to systematically assess the impact of these risks to its business

As part of the detailed risk assessment, Nationwides Enterprise Risk Management team works in collaboration with the business leaders across the multiple businesses to understand the risk that climate change poses over the strategic horizon This process involves identifying exposure for incremental risk and reward as well as assessing the companys capabilities against industry practices Risks associated with climate change as identified through Nationwides risk assessment process are discussed in the response to question four above

In order to measure the risks from certain natural perils potentially associated with climate change, Nationwide licenses the software and support of external catastrophe modeling vendors These vendors constantly review and update their models to incorporate the most recent science available 

These models allow Nationwide to measure their catastrophe exposure and develop a perspective on the potential size and likelihood of various catastrophes These models also allow the Nationwide companies to assess how various strategies will impact this risk including changes to deductibles, changes to market shares and geographic diversification

Specific to the hurricane peril, the major catastrophe modeling vendors have developed alternative event scenario catalogs associated with increased sea surface temperatures which some scientists might attribute to global warming Elevated sea surface temperatures are important because hurricanes are fueled by the warmth of the ocean These alternative event catalogs, therefore, represent a climate-conditioned view of risk This alternate view is used to assess the sensitivity of insured risk to elevated sea surface temperatures 

Beyond the direct output from the models, measurement and sensitivity analysis can be informed by maintaining external partnerships in academia, trade associations, experts from the modeling vendors, and reinsurers and brokers Nationwide has developed these types of external relationships and regularly avails itself of information from these sources as an integral part of the risk management program

Yes, the Companies do the following:  
Recycling: Our Companies participate in programs that encourage the recycling of paper, bottles and cans, as well as cardboards and plastics Document destruction bins and a pick-up service are used by multiple offices within the Companies that allow for proper destruction of paper files This service picks up, shreds, and recycles the paper in those destruction bins so that trees are preserved within the environment  The Companies continually strives to promote a greener environment by converting to paperless as much as possible and imaging paper files into electronic documents One of the office locations reminds email recipients under the signature line of their email to consider the environment before printing to conserve paper Email and phone communication, both with internal and external customers (namely policyholders) is encouraged to reduce the Companies carbon footprint and cut down on printed hard copy communications Whiteboards and digital projectors are also installed in meeting rooms so that the amount of paper consumed is reduced 
One example of the Companies demonstrating their care for the environment occurred when their office building was under construction Instead of purchasing brand new fixtures and furnishings, they reused some materials such as doors, window treatments, light fixtures and ceiling grid from the previous building to save on cost and to reduce the amount of waste that they were putting in the landfill As far as cleaning materials for our offices buildings are concerned, the selection of cleaning materials within some of the locations is carefully considered and a large portion of the cleaning products used in certain offices are either environmentally safe cleaning products and/or are white vinegar based 
Water & Conservation: Companies closely monitor outdoor irrigation, some to an extent that sensors determine whether or not the grounds actually need water based on the amount of rainfall that the area has seen Others are set on timers and only run during specific, set times to provide for a more predictable monthly water bill In addition, the setting of timers to determine watering schedule allows for the building grounds to be watered with optimum efficiency, thereby reducing over-watering Internally, certain buildings have a reverse osmosis system installed that provides filtered water to employees and is intended to promote the use of thermos/hard plastic water bottles and cut down on the amount of trash/recycling One of the Companies has low consumption water closets installed in all of the bathrooms to further reduce the amount of water used
Lighting: Some Company buildings are currently in process of or already are Energy Star Rated Some have converted incandescent lighting to fluorescent, low energy lighting Lighting of buildings at most office locations is set for regularly scheduled business hours and is of limited use on nights and weekends Parking garage lighting is also set on a timer schedule and only provides lighting during scheduled hours of the day, rather than continuously In addition, employees are encouraged to turn lights off in areas not in use and reminders are placed in those areas to encourage employees to conserve energy when possible In some offices, motion activated sensors have been installed for lighting so that energy is automatically conserved when an area is not being used 
Heating and Cooling: Companies monitor usage of heating and cooling systems and many set heat pumps back at night and during non-business hours to conserve energy usage when employees are not there When employees are in the building, heat and cooling system temperatures are closely monitored using a computerized environment with limited access, and systems run only when necessary rather than continuously On nights and weekends, heating and cooling can be limited to areas where an employee is based and is on a timer scheduled system Having areas on a timer system eliminates the need to heat or cool an entire building for an individual during non-standard business hours Regular, scheduled preventative maintenance is done on heating and cooling systems to ensure optimum efficiency and cut down on any possible wasted energy (this includes regular changing of air filters, etc) Some offices either have or are in the process of replacing older heat pumps with newer, more energy efficient units 
Technology: Company intranet pages and emails are encouraged as a main source of communication iPads are available to some employees at a few of the offices that help to minimize the need to print reports and materials for meetings with internal and external customers Additionally, the use of social media sites (Twitter and LinkedIn) provides an opportunity to communicate information electronically without the need for printing hard copies IT, at one location, is in process of enhancing their technology by converting computer monitors from LCD to LED and replacing older computer systems with more up to date, energy efficient models In addition, at one location plans are in place to convert the server room to a more energy efficient area that would promote less usage of cooling systems One office has installed power shut offs on all desk computer systems to further save on energy during non-standard business hours and weekends Some employees have the capability to access the office remotely to curtail transportation to and from the office Video/web conferencing is also becoming more common amongst offices to reduce the frequency of travel, but still allow individuals to meet on work-related topics 
Transportation: Carpooling has been adopted by a few of the offices as a means to cut down on the number of cars on the road and reduce emissions released by vehicles In addition, telecommuting is available to some departments, which allows for individuals to remote in and work from their home, saving fuel and reducing the emissions released into the air A few of the office locations have company cars that are either hybrid and/or get 30+ mpg Other offices are located in areas where most staff use public transport to get to work, rather than driving personal vehicles If using public transit to get to and from work, one office offers an employer sponsored public transit pass system to encourage continued use of public transportation One Company went so far as to relocate a satellite office that cut down travel time significantly for employees Others offer flexible work hours so that employees may take advantage of the opportunity to avoid high traffic time when commuting to and from work

Arbella Mutual Insurance Company,"  In addition to tracking research and analysis of experts in weather and climate change, we analyze historical data and trends related to climate change  The Chief Risk officer also meets annually with a well-respected research meteorologist to discuss all aspect of climate change and the risks posed to a Northeast property and casualty insurer

The biggest risk to our business identified from climate change is the potential for an increase in the frequency and severity of adverse weather including tropical storms/hurricanes, winter storms and convective storms in the New England region  Occurrence of such event(s) could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition as well as impair our ability to adjust and pay claims or to sustain our operations for a period of time  In order to combat these increased risks, the company has in place a robust reinsurance program with a well diversified and financially secure roster of reinsurers to supplement the company capital  Additionally the company has a contingent liquidity source should the need arise via its membership in the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston  Management has set specific risk tolerances and limits surrounding its exposure to catastrophic weather to ensure it has adequate capital and liquidity to meet its obligations to policyholders and maintain appropriate levels of capital subsequent to such events

Management estimates the potential impact from an increase in adverse weather conditions  We use catastrophe modeling software to estimate potential losses from all major perils, including tropical storm/hurricane  We use multiple models and run them bi annually  The models are then stressed to account for more short term trends in weather conditions as well as for the potential impact from storm surge in coastal areas  Management also performs scenario analysis to estimate the potential impact of actual recent severe weather events outside its footprint as if those events occurred within the markets we serve, and has modeled actual historical New England events against our current portfolio  Both models utilized by the company estimate most New England historic hurricane events to be less than a 1 in 100 year event, which is within the companys established tolerance for wind risk  There are three historic events that fall between at least one of the models probability of 1:100 and 1:250 year events   The company has adequate capital to fund each models estimated losses for all historic New England hurricane events

Management constantly reviews the effectiveness of its disaster recovery plan to ensure that the Company could respond to the challenges other companies have experienced in the more recent storms that significantly impacted their ability to sustain operations  In addition, management has a catastrophe response plan which has been stressed tested to ensure that we can effectively provide the necessary services to our policyholders in the wake of a severe weather event, including an expeditious review of insured losses and payment of claims  These plans were put to the test in 2015 when Massachusetts experienced five winter storm catastrophes in a four week span bringing historic snowfall totals and record extended cold temperatures producing historic levels of claims from our policyholders  While we continue to assess the companys performance in all aspects, these historic events did not provide any notable disruption in the companys operations or impair its ability to meet policyholder obligations and needs  These plans were further stressed in March 2020 with the requirement to close our offices and transition 100% to a work from home environment in response to government mandated shutdowns related to COVID-19  Despite the challenges presented, the Company has continued to meet all its obligations to policyholders, employees, agents and other stakeholders with the majority of our workforce working from home through August 31, 2021

While it is clear that there are significant upwards trends in both economic and insured losses arising from natural catastrophes, if one normalizes the losses for changes in exposures and for societal changes these upwards trends largely disappear  For example there is no upward trend in the incidence or the intensity of the actual perils for tropical cyclone (hurricane, typhoon) or tornado  To illustrate this point, the chart below show that over the period 1980 to 2016, global weather-related economic losses do not display a discernible trend when normalized using local GDP

Similar results are seen for region-specific weather related losses normalized for exposure and societal changes using a number of different methodologies, for example population and wealth per head of population or number of housing units and wealth per household  Essentially there is a significant increase in both the number and the values of buildings and contents, oftentimes in areas that are particularly prone to weather-related catastrophes such as Gulf and Florida coastal areas 
We investigate trends in weather related losses by peril, as we recognize that the dominance of wind-related losses may disguise trends in other perils  This note is focused on North America, but similar results have been seen in a wide range of studies

PCS catastrophe losses for commercial lines are available from 1998 onwards The chart below shows US Commercial Lines losses for PCS catastrophe events excluding earthquake, hurricane and 9/11 Earthquake and terrorism have no relationship to climate change; and the relative infrequency of hurricane events makes it inappropriate to include them in a chart exhibiting less than two decades of data The events captured are severe convective storm (SCS: tornado, hail, straight line wind), flood, wildfire and winter storms The losses have been adjusted by state level GDP to normalize the losses for changes in exposures and for societal changes While there is a peak in 2011 driven by several SCS events in April and May of that year, there is not a notable upward trend in commercial lines insured losses over the period

Hurricane
Only a small proportion of hurricanes forming in the Atlantic Basin actually make landfall in the USA  Taking observations from 1880 onwards, there is actually a slight downward trend in the number of landfalling tropical storms and hurricanes  Taking observations from 1950 (before which the quality of the data in NOAAs database is lesser), there is virtually no trend in the number of landfalling hurricanes, as illustrated in the chart below







US Hurricane Landfalls

The paper Tropical cyclones and climate change, authored by Thomas R Knutson, John L McBride, Johnny Chan, Kerry Emanuel, Greg Holland, Chris Landsea, Isaac Held, James P Kossin, A K Srivastava and Masato Sugi, published in Nature Geoscience in February 2010, suggests that globally we might expect to see an increase in tropical cyclones intensity of between 2% and 11% by 2100, and a decrease in landfalling frequency of between 6% and 34%
The ERM team also investigates the potential for sea level changes to impact the storm surge that could occur in conjunction with hurricane  In a number of areas, the effect is compounded by land subsidence, for example the subsidence due to post glacial rebound in New York, and groundwater extraction in New Orleans 
Tornado
Tornado data is available as far back as 1950; however the older years understate the number of the least damaging EF-0 tornadoes  The introduction of Doppler radar combined with increasing population and greater ease of recording and reporting events via cell phones and other mobile devices have greatly increased the number of EF-0 tornadoes reported  However, the number of tornadoes for categories EF-1 to EF-5 shows no trend over the period from 1950 onwards losses, nor is there any trend in the proportion in each category EF-1 to EF-5

Additionally, tornado losses show no trend once they have been normalized for exposure and societal changes as shown in the graph below (Dr Pielke-House SST Testimony to the Subcommittee on Environment, December 11, 2013)   The 2011 peak represents the April and May SCS events of that year however this does not show a notable upward trend over the period of 1950-2012

Flood 
From a risk management perspective, coastal flooding due to tropical cyclones is considered within our hurricane risk assessment  However we also consider riverine flood and surface water flood   Anticipated long term climate change impact on rainfall, including extreme precipitation days, varies significantly by territory  However, at present flood appears to be affected more by socio-economic changes, such as the increase in paved areas that results from urbanization, than by changes in climate
If one considers flood losses excluding storm surge associated with hurricanes (and post-tropical cyclones like Sandy), then flood losses are actually a decreasing proportion of the US GDP
Measures such as the annual mean US runoff and the percentage of streamages above bankful streamflow show no upward trend  Flood damages as a percentage of GDP show no upward trend; the chart below shows flood damages, excluding coastal flooding, as a percentage as GDP (red line), and flood damages indexed on construction cost 
We continue to investigate computer models for riverine flood and surface water flood Initial analyses indicate that this peril is not material for the Group compared to other catastrophe perils

Drought
Within the past century, the most significant drought event was the dust bowl of the 1930s  During the last century, it is apparent that the El Nino / Southern Oscillation (ENSO) have a significant impact on the USA rainfall / drought conditions, in addition to which there appears to be an underlying modest upwards trend in the Severely to Extremely Dry acreage in the USA  
The chart below shows the US national percent area that is severely to extremely dry for each year 1895 to 2016  The green line shows the peak month in each year, and the red line show the annual average There is no upward trend in either data set

https://wwwncdcnoaagov/sotc/drought/201607

When investigating the potential impact of climate change it is beneficial to obtain data for a longer period  NOAA has results from paleoclimatology studies that provide information on drought in North America spanning centuries   In the late 16th century there was a drought significantly more severe than anything subsequently experienced in the USA  These studies also indicate that droughts similar to the 1950s, in terms of duration and spatial extent, occurred once or twice a century for the past three centuries (for example, during the 1860s, 1820s, 1730s) (North American Drought: A Paleo Perspective, Created by the Staff of NOAA Paleoclimatology Program, November 12, 2003)
From an insurance perspective, the business line that might be most significantly and directly impacted by drought is crop insurance  Berkley insurance companies do not currently offer this coverage There is also a link between extended periods of drought and frequency and severity of wildfire

Wildfire
As one measure of wildfire trend we monitor annual acres burned  There are a number of factors that might influence acres burned, including controlled (deliberate) burning to reduce wildfire fuel, increased housing density in wildland areas, and periods of drought
 
 Source Data: National Interagency Fire Center, Total Wildland Fires and Acres (1960- 2016)  (Note: Figures prior to 1983 may be revised as NIFC verifies historical data)
https://wwwnifcgov/fireInfo/fireInfo_stats_totalFireshtml

Historically, wildfire has impacted personal lines insurance far more than commercial lines; for the period 1998 through 2014 commercial losses averaged less than 5% of the annual PCS wildfire losses Over 2015 and 2016, the commercial lines share increased to 17% and 42% respectively; this could be purely random or it might indicate more commercial structures being built in areas prone to wildfire
We continue to monitor the composition of PCS losses, and our own losses as a share on PCS loss by peril

"CHA HMO, Inc.","  If this were to happen, it could lead to increased incidences of chronic illnesses and in the type of clinical services Humana will need to offer its members For example, ""The Impacts of Climate Change on Human Health in the United States: A Scientific Assessment"" published by the US Global Change Research Program notes that climate change is already resulting in significant public health impacts which will continue to worsen if greenhouse gas emissions are not addressed

If Humana did not prepare for changes in physical climate, it is possible that Humana could suffer a loss in market share due to lack of readiness as well as increased operational costs associated with more health-related claims being filed   It is difficult to assess the financial impacts of these risks given the complexity of climate change and population health, however we do not currently anticipate substantial bottom line impacts

Climate change risks may also affect Humanas premium pricing, and therefore projected revenues associated with our services  Pricing and revenues are sensitive to several factors that may be impacted by climate change, including catastrophes or extreme weather events including public health epidemics or severe weather (eg hurricanes)  We continually review estimates of future payments relating to benefit claims costs for services incurred and make necessary adjustments to our reserves, including premium deficiency reserves where appropriate However, these estimates involve extensive judgment, and have considerable inherent variability that is sensitive to claim payment patterns and medical cost trends Senior level management will review pertinent information and have the ultimate authority to recommend changes in services offered and cost structures related to shifts in claims filed, or other company procedures in order to reduce impacts from these changes in customer claims and health trends related to changes in climate  The results of our partner dialogues and regional trending will inform future decisions around services offered to mitigate these impacts

Risks driven by changes in regulation

The financial risks resulting from an increase in operational and capital costs due to climate change-related regulations are considered to have a low magnitude of impact because energy expenditures represent less than 01% of Humanas total $495 billion operating budget Though operating expense increases due to energy taxes and regulations would have a material impact on budgetary costs, the overall operational cost impact for the portfolio would be minimal

Humana's Workplace Solutions team continuously evaluates short term and long term regulatory risks around energy and carbon A combination of forecasted energy costs due to general commodity price pressures, taxes and regulations or other impact is evaluated by the team to manage evolving financial exposure to energy prices In order to curb projected increases, the team works to budget for cost and environmental impact mitigation efforts such as energy efficiency projects to manage this risk This resulted in the formulation of an aggressive energy and carbon reduction target for the portfolio in efforts to manage operating costs and reduce Humana's environmental impacts

Risks driven by changes in physical climate parameters 

Increases in average temperature could result in more cooling degree days for Humana's data centers which could increase cooling loads at these and other locations

Any rise in average temperature that results in more cooling degree days throughout the year could increase cooling costs at Humana facilities, and in particular the company's data centers  Based on peer-reviewed research published in 2014, Humana has estimated the cost implications of rising data center energy consumption due to an increase in cooling degree days The potential aggregate estimated cost increase from 2015-2030 is $668,000, which is less than 01% of Humanas $7,525 million operating costs in 2018

Humana has worked with its equipment partners, done extensive modelling of air flow and cooling loads, and is implementing optimization strategies to minimize the cost of cooling and reduce the temperature differential required, while maintaining the reliability and performance of its data center equipment  For example, our IT and Facilities Management teams collaborated to install new building management systems (BMS) at the data centers These systems provide visibility into energy efficiency opportunities such as upgrades to lithium batteries and the addition of smart tiles to enhance the BMS system by monitoring air flows not just at the cabinet level, but also at the overall level 

While Humana does not have a direct cost associated with managing cooling degree days, past and ongoing investment in data center energy efficiency mitigates the risk by reducing overall energy consumption For example, Humana continues to use modeling software and tools purchased prior to the reporting period to optimize air flow and cooling needs In 2018, the hardware for the Tridium BMS system cost $25,000; funding came from the HUM Workplace Solutions Facilities Management team capital budget and the Facilities Management vendor managed the work

Significant weather events could also negatively impact our business by disrupting regular operations and limiting accessibility for our employees as well as our members Our Florida, Puerto Rico, and Texas operations in particular are located in areas that often experience severe storms As our data centers have disaster recovery methods in place to manage for risks unrelated to climate change, the estimated financial implications of this type of service disruption are considered to be low We relocated our recovery systems to Kentucky as a direct result of the lessons learned from Hurricane Maria, supporting our efforts to mitigate against hurricanes and other weather events, for which the financial implications are difficult to assess

To decrease the potential of business interruption due to a significant weather event, Humana's data centers maintain two separate power inputs, from different grids The centers also maintain a robust generator system that can provide power for 3-5 days before requiring re-fueling, while fuel service is contracted for a priority refill if requested Dual cooling systems are also in place Data center exterior walls were built to exceed ""tornado-level"" winds of over 100 mph, and both data centers are built on land not susceptible to flooding Humana maintains a secondary data center to support disaster recovery of technical systems In addition to our facility-specific management methods, Humana also has a robust work at home program, allowing staff to work remotely should there be an instance of reduced accessibility/pandemic or other issue

The management methods described, including the data center specifications, our Business Continuity Program, and our work at home program, are considered to be routine operations for Humana to manage for several risks and opportunities in addition to the potential effects of climate change

Futhermore, American Family is a member of the Insurance Institute for Business and Home Safety (IBHS)  The following text, prepared by IBHS, is a brief description of the Institute and some of its activities that relate to the issue of climate change
IBHS is a 501(c)(3) organization, wholly supported by the property (re)insurance industry, which conducts objective, scientific research to identify and promote effective actions that strengthen homes, businesses and communities against natural disasters and other causes of loss IBHS does this by identifying and advocating improved property design, construction, retrofitting, maintenance, repair and preparation practices  IBHS guidance for mitigating property losses is available directly to the public and to our members/policyholders, at wwwdisastersafetyorg, and through social media (eg, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, YouTube and Vimeo)
IBHS advocates the concept of going green and building strong recognizing that addressing climate change involves reducing greenhouse gas emissions and adapting homes, businesses, and communities to severe weather that may result from climate change:
	As an insurance-supported organization, IBHS recognizes that climate change strategies must do more than build structures to be energy efficient  They must be built to modern fire protection standards to help resist fire and avoid the water/chemical deluge needed for fire suppression; they should be strong enough to avoid wind destruction and resulting relocation in landfills; and properties should be sited and elevated in a manner that protects against flooding and environmental degradation from landslides  All of these are part of going green
	IBHS also firmly believes that adaptation is critical, not only to reduce long-term property insurance losses, but to buttress individual and societal resilience  All of the property protection measures that IBHS advocates to strengthen structures against current weather threats will also reduce future losses caused by climate change events  And, the unprecedented scientific research conducted at the unique IBHS Research Center is critical to identification of new mitigation actions that may help protect against more severe weather events
	Additionally, research conducted by IBHS will help to make sure that green building enhancements do not inadvertently cause structures to be less disaster-resistant, or even worse, threaten the life safety of occupants or first respondersfor example, photovoltaic arrays that take flight or pose fire suppression challenges are the antithesis of building strong

ACE has been a leading proponent and user of catastrophe models to quantify natural catastrophe risk for product pricing, risk management, capital allocation purposes and to simulate and estimate hurricane losses ACE uses models to aggregate and monitor natural catastrophe exposures across its portfolio and to ensure that its capital base is sufficiently strong to meet the expectations of regulators, rating agencies and policy holders and to provide shareholders with an appropriate risk-adjusted return This information is valuable in identifying possible market opportunities

ACEs risk management modeling and underwriting practices are adapted to the developing risk exposures attributed to climate change Since the earths climate appears to be changing in ways inconsistent with the historical record upon which catastrophe models draw data, ACE has adopted a shorter-term view of event frequency that is higher than the long-term historical frequency Standard & Poors has rated ACEs ERM process Strong, placing it among the top 20% of North America and Bermuda insurance companies in S&Ps May 2015 ERM rating report  

ACEs process accounts for the potential impact of catastrophe and climate risks on the companys own facilities and operations Although minimal, direct risk to ACEs business operations exists if such weather events occur in places where ACE has offices ACE has developed a Business Continuity Program, which has been tested during severe weather events, and ACEs operations have functioned effectively

ACE identifies all known and emerging risks that could have a significant impact on overall capital levels and financial results Our analysis of the impact of risks ranges from the known (based on definitive historical loss experience) to the hypothetical (based on a probable maximum (PML) calculation) Regarding the potential effects of catastrophe losses, we continue to closely monitor our catastrophe risk accumulation around the world

Prudential Insurance Company of America," As of the writing of this survey, the Environmental Task Force is working on an updated firmwide Environmental Commitment Our 10K, Annual Report and Sustainability Report disclose those risks we consider to be material in this area for the company

To execute this commitment, Prudential created an Environmental Task Force that focuses on
monitoring issues related to climate change for Prudentials businesses This Task Force reports to the Vice Chairman of the Company and is staffed by Prudential executives It has been led by a fulltime sustainability executive  the Director, Environment and Sustainability  who is housed in the office of Prudentials Chief Governance Officer

Bankers Specialty Insurance Company,"

Bankers does not have a definitive investment policy that addresses climate change  97% of Bankers investments are domestic investment grade bonds, including an allocation of approximately 10% to government bonds  Bankers expects that emerging markets are going to be more negatively impacted than developed nations by climate change and Bankers is well positioned for that change  Additionally, Bankers has no investments in volatile industries such as coal or any other mining industry, and very limited exposure in the energy sector with only about 1% of invested assets  Bankers has limited its energy investments to pipeline assets rather than to those tied to exploration or the refining part of the industry 

Bankers has placed itself in a solid investment position by placing only a little over 5% of invested assets in utility companies and approximately 15% of those invested assets are in securities with a maturity date greater than 6 years from today  Included in these investments is NextEra Energy, which is one of the leading clean energy companies

Bankers has not altered its investment strategy in response to these considerations, since the types of investments Bankers owns should create limited exposure to climate change",4

Alterra America Insurance Company,"  Below is the overall Markel Group response, which is how the climate risk environment is currently being managed on a go-forward basis, even though this survey is for 2012

General Overview of Survey:
Markel Corporation, the parent and sole shareholder of Alterra America Insurance Company (the Company)views and manages its risks at a consolidated level, not on a per insurance company legal entity basis  

The Company's insurance operations are office-based and, consequently, do not produce significant emisions in comparison to, for example, industrial operations  The Company seeks to operate efficiently and to minimize waste, which contributes to reduced emissions  The Company has also moved forward on a variety of ""paperless"" office initiatives in recent years, which contribute to efficiencies and have the secondary effect of reducing emissions

As previously reported, the Company continues to consolidate datacenters where and when possible across Markel North America  In 2012, 4 remote datacenters were consolidated into the datacenter located at the Company's headquarters  The Company has made significant progress over the past year in virtualizing our environment, and currently estimates a 95% virtualization of servers  Virtualization is a process whereby applications are run in separate, isolated partitions (separate virtual machines) within a single server  Widely used in datacenters, each virtual machine runs its own operating system and application and can be moved or copied from one server to another for load balancing or to expand processing capability  Along with greater utilization of hardware, this ""live migration"" feature is one of the major benefits of using virtual servers

The Company's affiliated non-insurance operations tend to engage in light manufacturing or service businesses and are not significant producers of emissions",0

Bright Health Insurance Company,  The company's investment strategy/portfolio is limited to low risk investments intended to minimize the risk of financial loss that could increase the risk of insolvency or negatively impact the companys risk-based capital requirements,4
Highmark Casualty Insurance Company," Climate change risks are embedded in many company processes and are managed like other risks, from inherent risks of underwriting exposures, facilities management and investment risks The company has taken an active role in considering its impact on the environment and has taken steps to lessen any negative impacts to the environment or climate change 

With respect to investment management, the Companys investment portfolio may be impacted due to climate change or related activities, and this is one of many factors that may be considered in investment decisions Climate change has not been formally imbedded into investment policies, but climate change considerations generally are included in the investment management process when determining if it may be significant to returns of investments in particular companies or industries (such as emission standards for auto companies, cost of pollution controls for utilities, demand for fossil fuels for an energy exploration company,  or pricing of catastrophic losses by a property insurer in flood-prone zones, for example)

HealthNow New York Inc.," 
HealthNow utilizes information provided by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, to identify climate change-related risks and impacts on our region According to the NYS DEC, immediate impacts include: increase in average annual precipitation with more concentrated in the winter than the summer; increase in overall amount of precipitation during heavy events (downpours); and a decrease in the winter snow cover 
The expectation from NYS DEC is that more warming will occur in Northeastern New York Its predicted that by 2100 the growing season will be 1 month longer with intense summers (heat waves and extreme heat) and milder winters Also predicted is a continual increase in precipitation 
HealthNow New York has a Business Continuity Plan that would address protocols in the event of an extreme weather event There is also an Incident Triage Team that can be enacted in the event that they are needed to make decisions regarding the safety of employees at all locations, due to these weather events 
We also have a team of analysts that identify medical trends and can recommend actions to take to get ahead of, and react to, these trends This is important, as the longer summers have brought with them an increase in health risks Warmer temperatures increase pollen production and ground ozone formation, which exacerbates asthma, allergies, and other respiratory conditions Also the change in climate favors the survival of insects and disease carriers, such as mosquitoes and ticks that may increase West Nile virus and Lyme disease diagnoses

Medco Containment Insurance Company of New York," Climate change is one of the many risks that are considered Cignas general account investment portfolio consists predominately of fixed-income assets While the primary risks Cigna undertakes are credit related, climate change can play a role in our evaluation of the creditworthiness of specific issuers and industries Potential risk factors include: 
 Changes in regulatory requirements (eg, emissions controls); 
 Changes in supply/demand for fuel (eg, oil, natural gas); 
 Developments in renewable energy sources; and
 Effects of extreme weather events on industries and issuers 

Climate change may impact certain investments For example, commercial real estate may become less desirable due to climate change factors such as global warming, rising sea levels or hurricane activity This could adversely affect a property's value as collateral for a commercial mortgage loan Climate changes can influence the inflation outlook and/or creditworthiness of specific emerging market issuers (eg a reduction in rainfall can cause food prices to rise, increasing inflation)

American Heritage Life Insurance Company," The Enterprise Risk and Return Council (""ERRC"") is Allstate's senior risk management committee and includes the CEO, business unit presidents, enterprise and business unit chief risk officers and chief financial officers, general counsel, and treasurer The ERRC convenes monthly to assess and manage risks and opportunities, including topics
related to climate change, which may impact the company

Additionally, Allstate's Sustainability Leadership Committee, composed of officers and senior staff from across the company, meets on a quarterly basis in order to guide environmental efforts from an enterprise wide perspective, build alignment, create momentum for Allstate's heightened sustainability efforts, and identify opportunities associated with environmental responsibility and climate change

The Enterprise Risk and Return Dashboard Report, prepared quarterly for the ERRC, Audit Committee, and the Board of Directors, is one of the tools used to evaluate key risks, strategies, and actions This Dashboard Report allows Allstate to compare risk exposure with the company's enterprise action plan targets by capturing key information and metrics on material issues, such as catastrophic and severe weather events, quarterly auto and property insurance underwriting results, business continuity, disaster recovery plans, and investment concentrations Regulatory changes, customer behavior trends, and Allstate's current public reputation are also considered To the extent climate change results in more natural catastrophic events or an increase in the severity of catastrophe events or both, the cost of reinsurance or other risk transfer mechanisms (eg, catastrophe bonds) is likely to rise, resulting in higher prices or unavailability of property insurance for consumers Emerging risks and opportunities are also identified and reported as part of the quarterly Dashboard reporting process
 
Risks and opportunities are generally assessed at an enterprise or business unit level rather than an asset or localized level The cross-functional Sustainability Leadership Committee ensures that risks and opportunities confronting company assets are considered when evaluating climate change-related risks at the enterprise level The Sustainability Leadership Committee completes an annual review of Allstate's operations, stakeholder expectations, and competitive actions in this space to identify internal opportunities related to climate change The Committee considers potential opportunities related to employee engagement, current and future regulation, improved operational efficiencies, and customer and consumer expectations Allstate's Vice President of Corporate Responsibility, who leads the Sustainability Leadership Committee, reports to the senior -management team on the efforts and assessments of the committee

Climate change, to the extent it produces rising temperatures and changes in weather patterns, could impact the frequency or severity of weather events and wildfires, the affordability and availability of homeowners insurance, the number and severity of claims submitted by our customers, and the results of our Allstate Protection business Property insured by Allstate throughout the United States could be affected by changes in precipitation and extreme droughts

Additionally, there is an opportunity for Allstate to build its reputation for its sustainability efforts among consumers and other key stakeholders who are increasingly interested in the environment and the impacts of climate change on our company This opportunity could enhance customer and consumer consideration thereby potentially increasing Allstate's customer base

Climate change, to the extent it produces rising temperatures and changes in weather patterns, could impact the frequency or severity of weather events and wildfires As a property and casualty insurer, we may face significant losses from catastrophes and severe weather events across the United States We may incur catastrophe losses in our auto and property business in excess of: (1) those experienced in prior years, (2) the average expected level used in pricing, (3) our current reinsurance coverage limits, or (4) the estimated loss from external hurricane and earthquake models at various levels of probability Despite our catastrophe management programs, we are exposed to catastrophes that could have a material effect on operating results and financial condition For example, our historical catastrophe experience includes losses relating to Hurricane Katrina in 2005, which totaled $36 billion, and Hurricane Andrew in 1992, which totaled $23 billion

To the extent that climate change impacts valuation of commercial real estate properties or municipalities in which we invest, our investment results would be impacted Allstate's investments throughout the United States could be affected by risks associated with other physical climate drivers

Increases in claims resulting from future extreme weather events could lead to increased operational costs The highest risk areas are major metropolitan centers in counties along the eastern and gulf coasts of the United States

Climate change, to the extent it produces rising temperatures and changes in weather patterns, could impact the frequency or severity of weather events and wildfires, the affordability and availability of homeowners insurance, the number and severity of claims submitted by our customers and the results of our Allstate Protection business Property insured by Allstate throughout the United States could be affected by changes in precipitation and extreme droughts

Property catastrophe exposure management includes purchasing reinsurance to provide coverage for known exposure to hurricanes, earthquakes, wildfires, fires following earthquakes, and other catastrophes We continue to attempt to capture our reinsurance cost in premium rates as allowed by state regulatory authorities To the extent climate change results in more frequent catastrophic weather events, the cost of reinsurance is likely to rise, resulting in higher prices or unavailability of property insurance for consumers

Allstate supports changes in the regulatory environment, including promoting the creation of government sponsored, privately-funded solutions for mega-catastrophes, that will make insurance more available and affordable

Allstate is engaged in an on-going evaluation of climate change as it relates to the company's future risk exposure, which may be affected by the federal government's ability to prepare for and respond to climate¬change-related catastrophes (eg sea-level rise) Allstate regularly monitors all significant enterprise risks and opportunities, including 
those related to climate change, using fluid risk identification processes that reflect a continuously shifting external and internal risk environment and reports to the Board of Directors, Audit Committee, and ERRC Changes in regulations, customer behavior, Allstate's reputation, and other risks are considered

One of the objectives under the environment pillar of the corporate responsibility plan is reducing greenhouse gas emissions A primary strategy for this is the development of the 2019 American Family Insurance (AFI) Sustainability and Climate Action Strategy The strategy will utilize operational carbon/GHG data to inform a path toward NetZero and provide the foundation from which future capital and operational expenses can be prioritized The Sustainability and Climate Action Strategy will serve as the primary guide for short term environmental action over the next five years  with medium and long term goals outlined AFI also has an energy management strategy with the goal of continuously improving efficiency across owned facilities The strategy is managed by a cross-disciplinary team that includes representation from Facilities, Information Services and Data Center Management It includes rigorous efficiency and emission targets out to 2025 with a continuous improvement cycle for strategic planning updates annually Measurement towards these goals has been in place since 2008, when the company established an energy management baseline In 2007, the company completed a third party-reviewed greenhouse gas emissions inventory Owned real estate is actively maintained with the Energy Star portfolio and includes multiple certifications In 2012, variable frequency drives were installed in both data centers and non-data air conditioning centers to reduce energy use  Solar panels have been installed in five locations for a total of 220kW of renewable power generated on site  The company now has 2 Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Certified facilities in its portfolio (Eden Prairie, MN and Madison, WI) with a 3rd currently LEED registered facility in Madison, WI Complementary programs include building envelope upgrades, green roofs, HVAC fixtures and controls, retro-commissioning projects, electrical fixture and controls updates, back up generation and behavioral modifications such as employee programs to power down equipment when it is not in use To date, these efforts combined have reduced our greenhouse gas emissions by 51,716 metric tons
Water reduction of 25 percent was achieved at the conclusion of 2011 resulting in 7 million gallons of water saved annually In some of our larger facilities ice/water machines are provided which has reduced plastic bottled water consumption Our onboarding program provides new hires with a reusable metal water bottle to use at the ice/water machines, eliminating the use of disposable cups In addition, the company partnered with our food vendor to eliminate single use cups at the coffee machines, providing reusable mugs for purchase
American Familys latest construction project, the Spark complex on Madisons east side, received the IBHS Fortified GOLD Commercial High Wind and Hail certification in April of 2019 It was the first commercial building in the country to receive this designation The structure was designed and built not only to be sustainable, but it was also built to some of the most stringent standards of resiliency known The structure itself was designed to be strong, safe for occupants and if necessary, has its own back-up power and HVAC systems so that it can remain operational even if the infrastructure fails 

American Family also supports transportation alternatives such as reducing the impact of business travel and employee commuting through increased use of webcasts and videoconferencing Since 2006, video conferencing systems and other telepresence technology have provided virtual communications alternatives to reduce travel In 2013, trailer skirts were installed on the over the road trailer, resulting in an annual 3 percent reduction in fuel use and an annual reduction of  2,400 metric tons of CO2 emissions In April 2012, The League of American Bicyclists designated American Family Insurances Madison, WI, headquarters as a Bronze Bicycle Friendly Business (BFB), based on best practices for staff and the greater community 
A zero waste initiative was launched in 2011 A Zero Waste Strategy is being developed for multiple waste streams across the enterprise A myriad of programs have been put into place towards achieving a 90 percent waste diversion goal including the direct diversion of construction and demolition waste, pre-consumer and post-consumer organic waste, office paper recycling and electronic waste recycling Reductions in the consumption of paper and office supplies have also been achieved In 2018, the company diverted 110 tons of organic waste from the landfill  Beginning in 2013, 40 percent of our customer-facing correspondence is sourced from 30 percent and 10 percent post-consumer content, saving an estimated 440 metric tons of CO2 at current volumes Since 2010 we have had a gently used office supply program as a default for employees

Massachusetts Mutual Life insurance Company,"M Life Insurance Company offer insurance products in life, disability income, long term care, annuities, and retirement services The companies do not write any form of property casualty insurance and so the climate change impact is limited to loss of policyowners life, disability of policyowners, impact on physical locations of the company, and impact on investments
At Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company, CM Life Insurance Company and subsidiaries and affiliates of each (collectively, MassMutual, or the company), efforts to address environmental sustainability are more than just good corporate citizenship These efforts also create opportunities to reduce operating costs which, ultimately, benefit the people who rely on MassMutual every day:  policy owners and customers
Throughout everyday business operations, the company works to reduce its environmental footprint by effectively managing facilities and the natural resources consumed  In 2018, MassMutuals headquarters in Springfield, Massachusetts was awarded the Leadership in Engineering and Environmental Design (LEED) Gold Certification from the US Green Building Council The building also previously achieved LEED Silver in recognition of the companys ongoing progress with its sustainability efforts In addition to this certification, MassMutual has five other initiatives to provide long-term benefits for its people, planet, communities and culture:
1) Solar technology - MassMutual has a 35 acre solar array containing 1,750 photovoltaic and thermal solar panels on the roof of its headquarters This technology provides 384,000 kilowatts (kWh) of electricity every year and supplies 50% of the hot water Over their 20-year lifetime, the panels will reduce carbon emissions by more than 5,500 metric tons Additionally, the company has similar technology at a Denver, Colorado facility Finally, MassMutual has started construction on a new building in Boston that is expected to be completed in 2021, with plans to have a LEED Platinum rated building that focuses on using a minimal amount of natural resources  
2) Lighting and Energy use  The companys comprehensive energy efficiency program ranges from high-efficiency lighting systems and ""daylight harvesting"" to updating some buildings to heat with cleaner burning fuel to powering lawn mowers with propane gas Cleaner burning fuel will reduce environmental emissions by 97% and the sulfur content will be reduced from 500 parts per million (ppm) to 15 ppm
The company utilizes high-efficiency lighting, heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems in the headquarters building, saving 450,000 kWh annually 
The companys Springfield Data Center has state-of-the-art technology and energy-efficient components for future growth This technology produces a savings of approximately 2,800,000 kWh per year, and due to their expected 20-year life, an anticipated lifetime savings of approximately 56,000,000 kWh Additionally, an upgraded chiller at the Enfield, Connecticut campus results in annual savings of 32,000 kWh
3) Waste Reduction  MassMutual utilizes technologies to reduce paper and water use As an example, over 500 water efficient plumbing fixtures reduce water waste by over 5,000,000 gallons annually The company has eliminated Styrofoam and single-use plastic straws from all campuses, and has adopted a plan to remove 50% of plastic cups from its campuses
4) Recycling  In 2018, the company recycled 2276 tons of paper and cardboard, 55 tons of e-waste, 12 tons of universal waste (lamps and batteries) and 12 tons of toner cartridges Additionally, MassMutual purchases eco-friendly office furniture and carpets made from recyclable materials that promote good air quality As part of a parking lot project at the headquarters in Springfield, Massachusetts, the company also installed a rain harvesting system that irrigates campus grounds reducing water usage as well as reduces storm water discharge from the campus 
5) Transportation  MassMutual provides over 64 free electric charging stations to employees and visitors with the infrastructure to handle 400, upgraded its facilities fleet to contain more electric cars, and utilizes bikes, scooters, Segways and trikes The company also provides support for carpooling and vanpooling, resulting in more than 250 employees using some form of ride sharing MassMutual Commuter Services has previously received the MassDOT Pinnacle Award for Excellence in Commuter Options
In 2018, MassMutual was recognized by the Ethisphere Institute, a global leader in defining and advancing the standards of ethical business practices, as one of the Worlds Most Ethical Companies for the fifth consecutive year MassMutual was one of only three honorees in the life insurance industry, underscoring the companys commitment to leading with integrity and prioritizing ethical business practices

SWISS RE LIFE & HEALTH AMERICA INC.,") as part of its risk management and underwriting process The company supplements this process with research into climate change and its economic impact The process is led by three units within Swiss Re, mentioned in question 2:

- Sustainability & Political Risk Management coordinates Swiss Re's climate change
engagement including our program of climate risk research
- Emerging Risk Management coordinates the identification, assessment, and monitoring
of new or emerging risks, including climate-related risks For example they have
concluded an assessment of the company's potential exposure to losses arising from
climate litigation, with a focus on the United States, and Swiss Re continues to monitor
this issue on a quarterly basis Further climate related areas which have been assessed
are heat waves, drought and wildfires
- Swiss Res Catastrophe Perils unit includes experts in windstorm, tropical cyclone and
flooding This unit is responsible for the design and maintenance of the company's
natural catastrophe loss models and supports the assessment of climate related risks
as part of the underwriting process for our insurance and reinsurance activities Guided
by collaboration with leading scientific institutions, the latest scientific knowledge, and loss experiences the models are updated accordingly on a regular basis The company's
risk and premium calculations are based on the probabilistic hazard models, which are
based on historic events To ensure our models and pricing calculations remain
accurate going forward in a changing climate, we have to make sure that we identify
significant future trends in natural hazards, quantify their long term impact on insured
losses and include findings into our risk models and underwriting processes

The Sustainability & Political Risk Management and Catastrophe Perils units collaborate
closely on our ongoing program of research devoted to enhance our understanding of
climate related risk and to assess the economic impacts of climate change on our portfolio
of business When this research generates valuable quantitative data, it is integrated into the company's risk management processes

Swiss Re has also implemented an internal platform in its property & casualty business
units called ""SONAR"" This initiative is designed to systematically screen evolving risks and changes in the risk landscape SONAR is a structure for the exchange of observations
associated with risk among different countries, cultures, and offices throughout the Swiss
Re Group SONAR thus helps to improve understanding of Swiss Re's future exposure by
reducing the degree of uncertainty related to future risks, including climate change risks

Swiss Re has entered several strategic groups to exchange knowledge on risk issues
including climate For example, Swiss Re is a member of the Chief Risk Officers Forum
Emerging Risk Initiative, which strives to present the insurance industry's shared position on emerging risks, and the company is a partner of the Global Risk Network of the World Economic Forum, contributing to its Global Risks Report Swiss Re is also a founding member of ClimateWise, an insurance industry platform to assess climate change risk A former CEO of Swiss Re is Chairman of ClimateWise and the company also serves on the Management Board

Swiss Re's research on the economics of climate adaptation (ECA) has a specific focus on
the impact of climate change on local economies The findings of ECA research are made
available on a country-by-country basis on our website, in addition to our print publications, and we continue to update this as new findings become available Swiss Re was closely involved in a new project incorporating the ECA approach working together with New York City See (chapter 2):

"Farmers Insurance of Columbus, Inc.","  We expect the overall losses from the perils of Wildfire, Flood and Hurricane, which are sensitive to climate change, to increase for society as a whole, and the insurance industry in particular  Wildfire risk is of particular concern to us given our concentration in the western United States    In addition, multiple causation risks, including natural and man-made causes, make it more challenging to fully understanding and quantify our exposure to risk

Farmers uses both internal and external catastrophe models to make our best assessment of prospective catastrophe risk for pricing, capital optimization and reinsurance purposes  We adjust the models based on our own experience, research and historical model performance  Our modeling work generates outputs on a deterministic and probabilistic basis which we use to manage our enterprise view of risk  While the modeling data and outputs continue to improve over time, there is still uncertainty around the outputs  Farmers views this uncertainty as a reason to be cautious and conservative in our selection and pricing of risk, and our overall tolerance of catastrophe exposure

An increasing number of regulatory functions encourage us to view risk arising from climate change  However, other regulatory functions disallow the use of this view in our pricing or risk selection and require that we underwrite our business without consideration of climate change  Many states do not permit the use of near term hurricane models that account for current sea temperatures and other factors which are viewed to be related to climate change  Other states do not permit the use of wildfire models, although these states will attest that we are in a period of higher than average fire risk  Some states will not permit changes to the models based on our experience, which limits our ability to utilize our experience and expertise in our business  We believe the insurance industry would be better able to address climate change and provide leadership on this issue if each state worked towards a consistent standard regarding climate change  As the populace is being encouraged to prepare and live as if climate change is real, the insurance industry must be permitted to do the same  

While climate change presents uncertainty, our continued work on model validation and correlation provides us with some level of comfort, at least over the next few years, that we can reasonably estimate our expected catastrophe losses during that time, with one major exception 

What we cannot account for or incorporate in our pricing or our own internal view of risk, is the exposure presented by regulatory uncertainty  Regulatory uncertainty includes actions such as directives issued by state insurance departments and governors limiting the application of hurricane and/or named storm deductibles to Superstorm Sandy claims, the reopening of earthquake claims numerous years after the Northridge Earthquake, the attempt to retroactively assess insurers for Texas Windstorm Insurance Association losses five years after Hurricane Ike, and other post event changes made to commonly understood practices that were instrumental in our decision to insure these risks  These types of actions cannot be predicted, and thus cannot be incorporated into our models

Kaiser Foundation Health Plan of Washington Options,"
KP carefully monitors studies and reports issued by government agencies and other organizations that speak to climate change-related risks, and uses these reports and findings to assess impact on KPs business
One way that KP may be able to regularly reassess climate change related risks over time is through health research carried out by the organization Two current research activities of note are:
1	Kaiser Permanentes Division of Research initiated a project, with funding from the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, titled Climate Change and Health: Assessing the Risk of Preterm Delivery The aims of the project are to: 1) examine the association between temperature during the warm season and risk of PTD, and 2) assess the above relationships by maternal factors including maternal age race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status in women who delivered in Kaiser Permanente Northern California hospitals between 1995 and 2009
2	In 2005, Kaiser Permanente launched a program aimed at building one of the largest and most comprehensive resources in the United States for research on the influence of both inherited and environmental factors on peoples health The databank created through this program, now called the Kaiser Permanente Research Bank, has the ambitious goal of recruiting 500,000 Kaiser Permanente adult members to share health information and a small blood sample for research As of April 2017, the Research Bank is halfway toward its goal The Research Bank is already paying dividends in scientific studies that are examining the role of genes and environment in conditions as varied as diabetes, cancer, bipolar disorder, heart disease, asthma, glaucoma, multiple sclerosis, and migraine  among many others DNA samples are used to produce genotypic markers on the whole genomes of Research Bank participants, making it possible to study the role of genes in many different diseases and conditions As of April 2017, 100 research projects have been approved to use data from the Research Bank, and 32 studies have been published, including 3 in the prestigious journal Nature Genetics With 19 studies published in 2016, the pace is accelerating KP investigators and collaborating scientists can conduct research to understand genetic and environmental influences  including weather and climate influences  on disease susceptibility, the course of disease, and response to treatment; as well as to translate these findings into improvements in medical care and public health By studying data pulled from Kaiser Permanente Research Bank participants' health surveys, electronic health records and DNA samples, researchers are now looking for new ways to diagnose, treat and prevent certain diseases

Liberty Mutual has a dedicated Corporate Exposure Management unit within the Corporate ERM department which has the responsibility for estimating the potential financial impacts of the Companys catastrophe risk exposure This unit is a vital component of Liberty Mutuals ERM program and uses probabilistic catastrophe models as well as other means such as industry benchmarking, realistic disaster scenarios, and historical loss experience to estimate the potential impact of catastrophes

This Corporate Exposure Management unit includes a Catastrophe Research and Development team which evaluates the catastrophe models for alignment with Liberty Mutuals view of risk In particular, the team considers a range of event frequency and severity assumptions beyond those embedded in standard models and builds bespoke models using Liberty Mutuals historical data, third party tools, publicly available scientific data, and input from expert consultants The R&D team also regularly participates in industry conferences to keep current with the latest scientific understanding of climate change
 
Severe natural catastrophes are incorporated into a stress testing regime, which Liberty Mutual performs regularly as a component of its ERM program Stress testing informs the Companys understanding of the financial impacts (earnings, capital, and liquidity) of various deterministic stress scenarios or combinations of scenarios In this way, the Company derives increased confidence that the current portfolio of exposures does not result in a capital or liquidity impact that exceeds established tolerances

Tokio Marine American Insurance Company," Any office could potentially be impacted by climate change related weather events For instance, climate change tisks can potentially increase the risk of wildfires in the West, increase the frequency and severity of hurricanes affecting the East Coast and Gulf of Mexico exposed areas, increase flooding affecting areas of the East Coast and Midwest and increase the frequency of tornadoes and other convective storms affecting the Midwest and Southeast The Tokio Marine Group has comprehensive business continuity plans that are updated and tested on a regular basis Financial performance of the companies could be negatively affected if climate change causes an increased number of catastrophe events that lead to widespread property and casualty losses

As property and casualty insurers that write business throughout the country, the insureds of the Tokio Marine Group are exposed to various weather hazards including
hurricanes, wildfires, flooding and severe convective storms Climate change may increase the frequency and/or severity of these events Significant changes in the frequency of natural disasters as well as the severity of damage can make it difficult to determine premium rates, set up adequate reserves and make proper arrangements for reinsurance

The increase in frequency and severity of North Atlantic Hurricanes and the resulting
catastrophic impact on coastal areas is of concern, as is long-term sea level rise Hurricanes account for approximately 70% of all North American wind losses In addition, coastal storms (including hurricane, tropical and sub-tropical storms and Nor'easter exposures) affect areas from Texas to Maine The tools discussed above in question 2 as well as focused research by TMH on the potential impact of climate change on hurricanes will enable The Tokio Marine Group to better manage hurricane and other catastrophe exposures

Liberty Mutual Insurance Company,"  Liberty Mutual has a comprehensive Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) program that has oversight from both executive management and the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors

A major component of the Companys ERM program is management of natural catastrophe risk from events such as hurricanes, earthquakes, and severe thunderstorms, tornadoes, hail, floods, wildfires, drought, and other natural catastrophes   The Company closely monitors changes to the frequency and severity of weather-related natural catastrophes, as well as changing demographic patterns (eg coastal migration) which could increase potential exposure to climate risk  Liberty Mutual rigorously manages of its natural catastrophe exposures through its ERM program, utilizing the latest exposure simulation models from AIR, Risk Management Solutions and Eqecat  As such, Liberty Mutual incorporates the most up to date scientific advances in the estimation of the Companys natural catastrophe exposures  

A vital function of ERM is establishing exposure and loss thresholds for natural catastrophe events and ensuring the amount of capital at risk does not exceed these thresholds  By using both the exposure simulation models, as well as historical loss trend data, Liberty Mutual is able to estimate losses for natural catastrophe events of various magnitudes and probabilities  This information is incorporated into strategic planning, pricing, and reinsurance purchasing decisions  Reinsurance products, which include traditional reinsurance, catastrophe bonds, and other risk transfer mechanisms, are used to ensure that the Companys net losses (and capital at risk) associated with significant natural catastrophe events does not exceed established thresholds

For internal ERM purposes, when evaluating the potential financial impact of losses related to hurricane exposures (the largest component of natural catastrophe exposures), Liberty Mutual utilizes a warm sea surface temperature (WSST) event catalog  This WSST event catalog incorporates the estimated increase in frequency and severity of hurricanes in response to sea surface temperatures that are higher than the long-term historical average  This ensures that Liberty Mutual is taking a conservative view of natural catastrophe risk and exposed capital

Another vital component of the ERM program is the monitoring and management of emerging liability risks  Liberty Mutual has a dedicated complex and emerging risks unit responsible for monitoring emerging risks and handling emerging risk claims, including climate change related risk and claims

Oversight of investment portfolio risks is also a component of the ERM program, as well as the Investment Committee of the Board of Directors

National union Fire Insurance company of Pittsburgh. Pa,"  The company actively analyzes the latest climate science to anticipate potential changes to our risk profile, pricing models, and strategic planning 

i) The scope of process:

Within AIG, risk management includes the identification and measurement of various forms of risk, the establishment of risk thresholds, and the creation of processes intended to maintain risks within these thresholds while optimizing returns The Enterprise Risk Management Department (ERM) supervises and integrates the risk management functions in each of our business units, providing senior management with a consolidated view of the firms major risk positions ERM monitors all significant enterprise risks and opportunities on a regular basis, including future, potentially material risks related to climate change, such as catastrophic weather To control catastrophe exposure, AIG uses a combination of techniques, including setting key business unit limits based on an aggregate probable maximum loss, monitoring and modeling accumulated exposures, and purchasing catastrophe reinsurance to supplement our other reinsurance protections

ii) How risks/opportunities are assessed at a company level:

AIGs Board of Directors oversees the management of risk through the complementary functioning of the Risk and Capital Committee and the Audit Committee and interaction with other committees of the Board Next, the Group Risk Committee (the GRC) is the senior management group charged with assessing all significant risk issues on a global basis in order to protect AIGs financial strength, optimize intrinsic value, and protect AIGs reputation among key stakeholders AIG considers climate change risk and opportunities in its investment strategies, considering companies impact on the physical environment, such as how they manage greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions; vulnerability to climate change regulations; waste generation and management; product use impact; and environmental footprint reduction  Finally, AIG's Science team also evaluates climate change as it relates to future risk exposures with the goal of better understanding what climate science indicates about changes to the environment and develop a strategy to better anticipate changes that can influence AIGs risk profile


iii) How risks/opportunities are assessed at an asset level:
At a physical asset level, AIG does assess the risks and opportunities associated with the physical impacts of climate change, including individual facilities and office locations AIG has a Business Continuity plan to respond to any incident that may disrupt business operations, including extreme weather events The impact of Superstorm Sandy crystallized the importance of business continuity planning and the role of insurance The effect of Sandy raised awareness and heightened the perspective of such catastrophic events, particularly in the property and environmental markets

With these multiple levels of risk management processes in place and integrated across AIG, modeling and underwriting practices may continue to adapt to the developing risk exposures attributed to climate change



iv) The frequency of monitoring (in weeks/months/years):

Enterprise wide risks are evaluated and monitored at least annually at the multiple governance levels described above (ie, Group Risk Committee and the Operational Risk Committee) AIG monitors risks and opportunities on an ongoing basis to guide environmental efforts, including climate change related risks and opportunities

v) Criteria for determining materiality/priorities:
Within each business unit, senior leaders and executives approve risk-taking policies and targeted risk tolerance within the framework provided by ERM  ERM supports AIGs businesses and management in developing enterprise risk management processes for our key day-to-day operations and in identifying, assessing, quantifying, managing, and mitigating AIGs risks Accountability for the implementation of risk policies is aligned individual corporate executives, with the risk committees receiving regular reports regarding compliance with each policy to support risk governance at our corporate level as well as in each business unit

vi) To whom are the results reported:

The Finance and Risk Management Committee of the Board of Directors periodically receives updates from AIGs ERM function and review the results of stress tests  Should a risk related to climate change be identified and become material, it would also be elevated through this established ERM process, with the results reported to the Board or Committee of the Board In addition, general accountability for the implementation and oversight of risk policies is aligned with individual corporate executives, with the risk committees receiving regular reports regarding compliance witheach policy to support risk governance at our corporate level as well as in each business unit",2

We file Rideshare Plans for each office with over 250 employees in Los Angeles, Orange, San Bernardino and Riverside counties In many instances, the Auto Club and the Exchange share facilities, allowing these plans to cover both entities Annually, these plans are submitted to, reviewed and approved by the South Coast Air Quality Management District The plans provide strategy, implementation and results of achieving average vehicle ridership goals for employees commuting into those large offices on a regular basis Some specific segments of the plan include financial and non-financial incentives for those who carpool, vanpool, use public transportation, bicycle, or walk to work in lieu of driving a vehicle as a single passenger In 2018, the Auto Club provided financial incentives for those who drove electric vehicles and utilizes more efficient process for the employees The objective of these plans is to decrease the number of vehicles on the roads during the prime morning commutes and thus reduce emissions and greenhouse gases 

In a separate but related matter, we have a fleet of approximately 550 company vehicles in California, 408 of which we use for our Insurance Operations We have progressively operated more fuel efficient and lower emission vehicles in this fleet Each year we review a plan including what vehicles we need to continue to operate and/or will be acquiring as older vehicles need replacement The vehicles have migrated from Low Emission to Ultra Low Emission to Super Ultra Low Emission to Partial Zero Emission and even Zero Emissions over recent years The objective is to lower costs, use less fossil fuel and reduce emissions and greenhouse gases emitted from these vehicles In our California operations, we have a total of 247 Ford CMax hybrids, 95 Ford Fusion hybrids and 3 Freightliner diesel hybrid large trucks Additionally, the Auto Club has 7 Smart Fortwo 100% electric vehicles These vehicles are being used in our fleet for Insurance Claims adjusters, Special Events and Procurement 

To service the fleet as well as other electric vehicles the Auto Club has installed a total of four, dual port, fixed EV charging stations One of the charging stations is located at our headquarters in Los Angeles at the corner of Adams and Figueroa, and another at our Costa Mesa Branch Office These stations are available for public use The other two charging stations are installed at our Administrative Office for fleet and employee use only The use of these electric charging stations is free encouraging our employees to personally drive plugin hybrids or 100% electric vehicles to and from work Since the installation of these stations, we have seen a rapid rise in employees driving electrified vehicles to work thus reducing emissions We are working with Southern California Edison to install two additional, dual port, fixed EV charging stations, at our Los Cerritos and Upland branches These will be DC Fast Charge stations and will be available for public use

The Auto Club Driving School (CA) has replaced 52 of the 61 gas-powered instructional vehicles with hybrids since 2015 The remaining 9 gas-powered instructional vehicles will be replaced in 2019 with Ford Fusion Hybrids that have arrived as of August 20th, 2019 We will be expanding the driving school into Texas Q4 2019 and have 1 Ford Fusion there ready to go Moving forward, all vehicles ordered for the organization, including the driving school and future ACE market expansion, will be Ford Fusion Hybrids The Ford Fusion Hybrids are used for teen-driver training throughout Southern California, reduce emissions, and improve gas mileage from 24 mpg to 44 mpg

The AAA Missouri ERS Club-Owned Fleet (COF) has 164 active service vehicles providing road service Of the 164 vehicles, 84 (52%) are light service vehicles which operate much more efficiently than a light duty / medium duty diesel tow-type truck We also operate one of the Smart vehicles for special events and peak call volume periods We currently have in operation a light-duty Hybrid diesel tow vehicle in the New Orleans COF operations as a replacement for a standard diesel flat-bed tow truck The Missouri COF is actively pursuing the potential use of either CNG or propane in the light service vehicle application The Club has encouraged the Contract Stations to make similar modifications within their own fleets wherever possible in attempt to reduce both their operating costs and emissions The total number of light service vehicles operating in the AAA Missouri territory is 441, combined between COF and Contracted Stations

Our Facilities and Construction division set sustainability standards for vendors and products An example would be our participation in programs such as Construction by Design In designing new construction or renovations we use native plant material that is drought resistant, install energy efficient LED lights, use recycled material in carpeting and other construction materials Existing materials are then recycled by the vendors to reduce our impact on the environment and landfills 

We work closely with vendors and utility companies to procure and utilize the most energy efficient (low emission) equipment possible and look for ways to reduce the actual consumption We continue to replace equipment that is the least efficient based on age and performance At our large administrative facilities we utilize contemporary building management systems and more energy efficient chillers that responds to the actual load required (variable speed drives) All new and renovated facilities are designed to be fully compliant with Title 24 regulations, including HVAC technology and light harvesting techniques We are monitoring our energy consumption with a third-party vendor This allows us to focus our capital investments on replacing equipment that is inefficient based on performance to reduce costs and consumption

Information Systems has adopted hardware standards that reduce our need to implement physical equipment We continue to reduce our physical footprint by embracing newer server technology such as virtualization, which reduces our overall power and cooling consumption In addition, Information Systems has adopted practices to efficiently manage cooling requirements within the Data Center We have adopted the practice of isolating cold isles from hot isles This enables us to redirect cooling to where it is needed, making cooling more efficient by eliminating the need to cool the entire room",0

Swiss Re Life & Health America Inc.," The most important components of our short-term strategy relate to the annual renewal of our reinsurance contracts for business exposed to weather-related risks such as flood and storm In pricing weather-exposed business we use our proprietary risk models These models are built/maintained by a team of 25 in-house experts, in close collaboration with leading scientific institutions Guided by the latest scientific knowledge, the models are updated accordingly on a regular basis Catastrophe Perils unit designs and maintains loss models and supports the assessment of climate related risks as part of the underwriting process  

The company encourages the management of climate related risks and the progression towards a lower carbon economy through re/insurance products supporting the development of renewable energy and investments in clean technologies These products are used in the renewable energy industry to help stabilize future earnings, reduce financing costs, and increase the attractiveness of investment in clean energy, thereby promoting its deployment 

One example is the wind industry Swiss Re offers tailor-made structured insurance and derivative solutions to manage revenue risk resulting from uncertain wind conditions enabling better financing terms to reduce capital costs Existing wind farms and new wind projects benefit from these solutions as they reduce revenue volatility A typical wind output hedge is structured to provide certainty in production volume at single or multiple sites Swiss Re can structure a hedge with the payout based on a parametric index to compensate against shrinking operating income due to lack of or excess wind By stabilizing future earnings and cash flows, the result is reduced financing costs, increased opportunities for future investment, and an important contribution enabling the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions Products using the same concept are used by clients in various renewable energy industries including, such as wind farms in Texas, hydroelectric generating facilities in the Pacific Northwest, and many other sites around the world

Re/insurance protection is an essential component for the development of renewable energy projects and therefore the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions Without insurance, the risks associated with the construction and operation of clean energy production facilities would make them less attractive to investors or potentially nonviable as an investment opportunity Swiss Re offers this kind of coverage for solar, wind, geo-thermal, small-scale hydro-electric and bio-mass production sites

In addition the ERM team regularly reviews pertinent scientific literature to ensure it understands current thinking on how climate change is impacting the perils that could currently or in future give rise to losses 
While it is clear that there are significant upwards trends in both economic and insured losses arising from natural catastrophes, if one normalizes the losses for changes in exposures and for societal changes these upwards trends largely disappear For example there is no upward trend in the incidence or the intensity of the actual perils for tropical cyclone (hurricane, typhoon), tornado, flood or drought To illustrate this point, the chart below show that over the period 1990 to 2012, global catastrophe economic losses have actually decreased as a percentage of GDP
http://rogerpielkejrblogspotcom/2013/03/graph-of-day-global-disasters-and-gdphtml
[Chart]

Similar results are seen for region-specific weather related losses normalized for exposure and societal changes using a number of different methodologies, for example population and wealth per head of population or number of housing units and wealth per household Essentially there is a significant increase in both the number and the values of buildings and contents, oftentimes in areas that are particularly prone to weather-related catastrophes such as Gulf and Florida coastal areas 
We investigate trends in weather related losses by peril, as we recognize that the dominance of wind-related losses may disguise trends in other perils This note is focused on North America, but similar results have been seen in a wide range of studies

Hurricane
Only a small proportion of hurricanes forming in the Atlantic Basin actually make landfall in the USA Taking observations from 1880 onwards, there is actually a slight downward trend in the number of landfalling tropical storms and hurricanes 
The paper Tropical cyclones and climate change, authored by Thomas R Knutson, John L McBride, Johnny Chan, Kerry Emanuel, Greg Holland, Chris Landsea, Isaac Held, James P Kossin, A K Srivastava and Masato Sugi and published in Nature Geoscience in February 2010 suggests that globally we might expect to see an increase in tropical cyclones intensity of between 2% and 11% by 2100, and a decrease in landfalling frequency of between 6% and 34% 
Tornado
Tornado data is available as far back as 1950; however the older years understate the number of the least damaging EF-0 tornadoes The introduction of Dopplar radar combined with increasing population and greater ease of recording and reporting events via cell phones and other mobile devices have greatly increased the number of EF-0 tornadoes reported However, the number of tornadoes for categories EF-1 to EF-5 shows no trend over the period from 1950 onwards losses, nor is there any trend in the proportion in each category EF-1 to EF0-5 Additionally, tornado losses show no trend once they have been normalized for exposure and societal changes

Flood
From a risk management perspective, coastal flooding due to tropical cyclones is considered within our hurricane risk assessment However we also consider riverine flood and groundwater flood If one considers flood losses excluding storm surge associated with hurricanes (and post-tropical cyclones like Sandy), then flood losses are actually a decreasing proportion of the US GDP

When investigating the potential impact of climate change it is beneficial to obtain data for a longer period NOAA has results from paleoclimatology studies that provide information on drought in North America spanning centuries In the late 16th century there was a drought significantly more severe than anything subsequently experienced in the USA These studies also indicate that droughts similar to the 1950s, in terms of duration and spatial extent, occurred once or twice a century for the past three centuries (for example, during the 1860s, 1820s, 1730s) Source Reference: http://wwwncdcnoaagov/data-access/paleoclimatology-data
From an insurance perspective, the business line that might be most significantly and directly impacted by drought is crop insurance Berkley insurance companies do not currently offer this coverage
Wildfire
If one were considering only the more recent years it would appear that there was an upward trend; however any such trend is much less apparent when the data is considered over a longer period There are a number of factors that might influence acres burned, including controlled (deliberate) burning to reduce wildfire fuel, increased housing density in wildland areas, and periods of drought

Athene Life Insurance Company of New York,"  Athene is in the early stages of building out its climate risk framework  Initial efforts include assessments of key risk areas expected to be most impacted by climate change, including the investment portfolio and insurance risks  Athene does not view climate risk as a standalone risk, but rather a risk that permeates through Athenes existing risk taxonomy

Athene has an Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) function to identify, measure, mitigate, manage and report on all material risks to the company, including emerging risks such as climate change The ERM function reports on material risks to Athenes Management Risk Committee (MRC) and Board Risk Committee (BRC)  The MRC is responsible for developing and implementing the systems and processes designed to identify, manage and mitigate reasonably foreseeable material risks  The BRC assists the Board in overseeing, identifying and reviewing risks that could have a material impact on the company

CIVIL SERVICE EMPLOYEES INSURANCE COMPANY						," These risks can be grouped into two main categories: physical and transition risks
Physical risks may arise from climate trends and shocks Beyond losses from physical climate damages, climate trends and shocks can pose economic disruptions which may affect resource availability and economic productivity, profitability of firms and individual assets, pose supply chain disruptions, and constrain insurance market growth Uninsured losses arising from physical climate factors may have cascading impacts across the financial system

Transition risks, arising from disruptions and shifts associated with the transition to a low carbon economy, motivated by policy, regulatory, markets, technological, or reputational factors affecting the value of assets 

The company has implemented a yearly filing schedule for all major products allowing for frequent coverage and pricing adjustments to mitigate current and emerging trends as well as transition risks It has also revised its reinsurance program and optimized it to provide coverage in a variety of situation including, but not restricted to, frequent multi-million dollars events and multiple large catastrophe event up to our 250-year PML",3

There are possibilities for regulatory and legal risk associated with climate change

Union Insurance Company of Providence," Significant changes in convective storm patterns, hurricanes, and droughts could impact the way in which EMC manages property exposure over time EMC monitors long-term weather patterns and geographical concentrations of risk as part of its catastrophe and exposure management processes Historical actions have been taken to reduce exposure concentrations in some catastrophe-prone areas and to limit growth in other areas Changes to our exposure distribution is being monitored throughout the year to ensure that exposure concentrations do not unknowingly exceed established guidelines 

In addition to managing exposure concentrations, EMC continues to evaluate opportunities to reduce losses from catastrophic events For example, EMC has increased deductibles and changed the way deductibles apply to commercial property policies with multiple locations EMC has also made a concerted effort to monitor insured values and make sure they are sufficient for the insured risk

EMC purchases aggregate catastrophe reinsurance as a component of its overall catastrophe management strategy In addition, EMC has protected its surplus and financial position by securing per risk and facultative reinsurance treaties on larger insured properties

Along with underwriting risk, severe weather could also have an impact on EMC corporate headquarters facilities, as well as its regional branch offices around the country  EMC has a very robust disaster recovery plan in place for each branch/
department which it is prepared to employ if and when it is necessary EMC's branch office locations, which are spread throughout the country, help to minimize the risk arising from severe weather effecting operations, as offices located in non-affected areas are available to assist the impacted offices meet the demands that would be presented if a physical office location was severely impacted by storms

Supporting Carbon Disclosure:
SLF Inc is a signatory to CDP, endorsing its annual questionnaire CDP has gathered the largest global collection of self-reported climate change information CDPs system enables companies around the world to measure, disclose, manage and share climate change information, playing a critical role in driving emissions reductions 

SLF Inc is a member of Corporate Knights Council for Clean Capitalism (CCC) SLF Inc contributes its experience and expertise with green buildings and bonds through participation in working groups supporting these initiatives 

From the CCC website (cleancapitalismcom): 
The CCC is a group of forward-thinking companies who seek the integration of ""clean capitalism"" principles into broader economic and social policy Clean capitalism is an economic system whose prices fully incorporate social, economic and ecological benefits and costs, and whose actors know the impacts of their marketplace actions By advocating for policy changes, the CCC seeks to create an economic model in which what is good for business is good for the environment and society

According to the CCC, they examined the market gaps that led to sub-optimal allocation of capital and set out a menu of high-impact, feasible policy options including:

a Sharing the tools and communicating the imperative to incorporate natural capital into our national accounts and provincial statements of financial position as a first step toward total wealth accounting Canada is now the only G20 country to include its natural resource wealth on its formal balance sheet, updated quarterly at a sectoral level of detail(1)

b Closing critical information gaps and ensuring access to finance to catalyze profitable energy efficiency investment opportunities The CCCs work has resulted in policy in Ontario that will require 15,000 large buildings to disclose energy and water use by 2018 This policy has also been included in the Federal Governments Pan-Canadian Framework on Clean Growth and Climate Change

c Supporting provinces to launch green bond programs Ontarios green bond program, initiated with CCC support, now totals CDN$205b Quebec joined this year with a CDN$500m issue Working closely with the Federal Department of Finance, the CCC was able to secure commitment by the federal government to undertake research to publish a Canadian green bonds framework consistent with international standards 

d The CCC worked with the Ontario Securities Commission to build support for better climate disclosure, resulting in a country-wide review by Canadian securities regulators of climate change disclosure The review is expected to improve climate disclosures of Canadian-listed companies in line with the Financial Stability Boards Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures recommendations

e The CCC worked with the UN Environment Inquiry to produce research for G7, which helped lead to a G7 communique calling for increased sustainable financing fundamental to the achievement of sustainability and climate goals

f The CCC worked with UN Environment Foundation and the 2017 Italian G7 Summit to author the context paper(2)  that led to launch of the Financial Centres for Sustainability(3)

"Farmers Insurance of Columbus, Inc.","  As an organization, Farmers recognizes that it is essential that we consider the impact we have on the environment, and that we create and foster a culture where all individuals are aware of opportunities to conserve energy and natural resources

We have initiatives in process that reduce our carbon footprint  These include changes in the way we manage our facilities, our fleet, and our travel 

Our goal is to purchase energy in an efficient, cost effective and environmentally responsible manner, and to establish and implement effective energy management programs

Our facility in Wilmington, DE has recently replaced all fluorescent fixtures with LED Fixtures These LED fixtures are typically 50% - 75% more energy efficient and have a useful life of 72,000 hours (82 years with 24/7 use) Projected savings over the next 10 years are $700,000 and 4,384 tons of CO2  We have previously installed a new Cool Roof product at one of our facilities and have installed solar panels in two other locations  We continue to implement electrical power conservation programs in multiple operations  In some locations we have installed motion sensitive light switches and energy saving light bulbs (such as ALTO lights from Phillips, which are recognized by the industry as energy-efficient lighting solutions), and in 2014 our claims office in  Oklahoma City, OK has replaced 154 existing parking lot lighting fixtures with more energy efficient LED light fixtures  In Austin, TX we have converted our 190,000 sq ft office and also our 9,000 sq ft office in McAllen, TX over to 100% green electricity through electricity provider contracts  In Grand Rapids, MI we have replaced (4) 25+ year old elevators with more energy efficient elevators which are projected to save $5,000 annually in electricity costs  In addition to these improvements, we have also implemented programs to remind employees to power down equipment when it is not in use  Many computer monitors and desktop computers are automatically set to go into a sleep or hibernation mode after a short period of inactivity

Depending on job assignment, employees may be provided with a company fleet vehicle  Since  2010, more fuel efficient, 4 cylinder vehicles have been selected for our general lines vehicles and the number of unassigned and pool vehicles at our various office locations has been reduced  Miles driven in 2014 were 33%lower than miles driven in 2010  A 44% reduction in the total tons of CO2 over this five year time period has been attained due to fewer vehicles in service, fewer miles driven and the decision to down-size from full-size to mid-size and compact vehicles 

As many Farmers employees commute to our business locations, we encourage ridesharing and the use of public transportation  In some locations, we provide incentives including subsidies for train passes, bus passes and vanpools, free shuttle buses from train stations, and preferred carpool parking spaces  

Telepresence technology and high quality HD video conferencing systems in many operations have helped minimize airline travel   

In addition to our focus on the reduction of emissions we have made improvements in our effort to reduce water consumption  Improvements include low volume sink faucets, low volume toilets, and waterless urinals  Other improvements within our operations include upgrades to programmable irrigation systems and pop-up sprinkler heads, which eliminate leakage and overspray

We continue to work on reducing utilization of paper and office supplies   Copier/printer machines in many of our locations are set for duplex (two-sided) printing and the print/copy default has been set to black and white vs color  We have completed the first year of a 3 year project to reduce the number of multifunctional devices (MDF) within our office buildings from 3,269 to 1,522 machines (53% reduction) and replace the remaining 47% with more energy efficient equipment; projecting an energy cost savings of $195,098, 1,300,653 KWh and 895 tons of CO2 over a 3 year period

Virtually all employee communications are handled electronically rather than through paper  As of 2011, semi-monthly statements of employee earnings and deductions have been electronically available and are no longer printed and mailed to employees  Improved ordering processes have lowered the volume of consumable supplies in many locations  Recycling programs have been implemented for paper, plastic, cardboard and glass  Printer, copier ink and toner cartridges are also recycled, as are cell phones, chargers and obsolete electronic equipment such as computers and monitors  In our mail rooms, we have begun recycling and reusing packing materials for shipping
We have implemented initiatives that provide customers with environmentally friendly choices that also reduce the organizations carbon footprint For example, in some operations, mail sent to agents and customers is delivered in envelopes made of recycled material  A new billing system available in some states and for some products provides increased on-line billing and payment capabilities  In some states and for some products, we are working to provide customers with the option to receive electronic policy forms and notices from us, rather than paper copies  Customers with these electronic policies may also have the option to receive bills, pay bills, and view their billing histories online  Some states prohibit the use of paperless communication with policyholders, which limits our ability to consider paperless options 

Our MultiCar auto policy, available in some states, can cover multiple vehicles on one policy, thereby reducing the amount of paper customers receive and our overall carbon footprint

In 2010, Farmers built a 164,000 SF facility in Oklahoma City that was recognized by the US Green Building Council as qualifying for Core and Shell LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) certification at the silver level, and also qualified for LEED certification for the Tenant Improvement portion of the project  1400 employees moved into the building in October 2010 and continue to work there today  

In some of our larger facilities: 1) ice and water machines are provided, reducing plastic bottled water consumption; 2) programmable thermostats are in place; 3) carbon footprint studies and energy audits have been completed; 4) Energy Star equipment is purchased whenever practical; 5) cleaning hours were revised to allow for more daytime cleaning, allowing us to deactivate interior lights earlier in the evening; 6) new employees are informed of our green business practices during their initial training classes and existing employees receive regular electronic communications on various energy-related topics, keeping awareness at a high level

In addition the two Print and Distribution Centers in North America have implemented several significant initiatives to mitigate impacts to the environment including: aggressive approach to deliver agent, customer and broker documents electronically versus traditional USPS mail;  On-line report viewing; purchasing of envelopes and stationary manufactured with paper from trees harvested from forests that are SFI (Sustainable Forestry Initiative) certified, Print-On-Demand of agent support materials versus warehoused stored materials; digitizing as much in-bound mail as possible via an active imaging approach; implemented many initiatives improving efficiency, lowering energy consumption, actively participating in operational recycling program, consolidating operations to a  two-site COE model and reducing operational waste from 4% to less than 2%",0
Seneca Ins Co Inc," Climate change poses a risk in terms of increase claims activity and loss potential Coverages that are most exposed, but are not limited to climate change are: D&O, Commercial General Liability, Errors & Omissions, Environmental, Property and Workers Compensation  

D&O:  There is the risk that companies who delay taking action on climate change, or are inadequately prepared, could be sued by their investors Directors and Officers may be liable for incurring higher costs as a consequence of unduly delaying emissions, reductions, damaging their companys reputation and failing to disclose investment-relevant information The Company has nominal exposure and typically avoids writing this coverage
Commercial General Liability:  There is concern that bodily injury or property damage from greenhouse gas emission may be covered under a CGL policy The Supreme Court has ruled that greenhouse gas emissions are pollutants subject to the regulation of the Environmental Protection Agency ISO pollution exclusions are generally attached on CGL policies for manufacturing risks 
Errors & Omissions: In the event of failures to infrastructure and buildings due to extreme weather conditions, then work of professional advisors may be scrutinized for not properly accounting for climate change in their design and development The Companys E&O portfolio consists predominantly of Accountants and Lawyers The company has very small number of policies from architects, surveyors, engineers and planners
Environmental Liability:  The Company understands that extreme weather events from climate change may lead to seepage from tanks and industrial sites 1-in-100 year flood plains and distance from rivers and other water sources are considered in underwriting these types of risks  In addition, oil and gas classes are avoided Approximately less than 3% of the Pollution legal liability portfolio consists of landfills 
Property: There is significant risk from property damage from higher sea levels caused by climate change  Most property policies generally exclude flood coverage and distance to coast is evaluated during the underwriting of accounts Climate Change is factored in the catastrophe modeling The Company has evaluated the impact of climate change based on near term frequency in the Gulf of Mexico, Florida and in the North Atlantic Basin which have the potential to be heavily impacted

Auto Club Group Insurance Company," 

ACIA offers an array of homeowners and automobile products throughout its footprint  Across these generations of products, the following features promote loss mitigation  The availability of each of these features in a particular market depends on the product generation and regulatory environment in that market

	Paperless functionality and discount
	Electronic payment options and discount
	Fortified Homes Discount (detail below)
	Storm Features Discount (discount for window and water protection)
	Storm Shutters Discount
	Hail Resistant Roof Discount
	Water Safety Level (discount for detection levels and automatic shut off)
	Green Updates Endorsement
	Wind Mitigation Discount

ACIAs Fortified Homes Discount is available when the dwelling is certified as Fortified for Safer Living by the Institute for Business and Home Safety (IBHS)

ACIA is also a member of the Insurance Institute for Business and Home Safety (IBHS), an organization focused on reducing weather related losses through research, education and preventative measures

The following text, prepared by IBHS, is a brief description of the Institute and some of its activities that relate to the issue of climate change 

IBHS is a 501(c)(3) organization, wholly supported by the property (re)insurance industry, which conducts objective, scientific research to identify and promote effective actions that strengthen homes, businesses, and communities against natural disasters and other causes of loss  IBHS does this by identifying and advocating improved property design, construction, retrofitting, maintenance, repair, and preparation practices IBHS guidance for mitigating property losses is available directly to the public and to our members/policyholders, at wwwdisastersafetyorg, and through social media (eg, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, YouTube and Vimeo)  

IBHS advocates the concept of going green and building strong recognizing that addressing climate change involves both reducing greenhouse gas emissions and adapting homes, businesses, and communities to severe weather that may result from climate change: 


	As an insurance-supported organization, IBHS recognizes that climate change strategies must do more than build structures to be energy efficient They must be built to modern fire protection standards to help resist fire and avoid the water/chemical deluge needed for fire suppression; they should be strong enough to avoid wind destruction and resulting relocation in landfills; and properties should be sited and elevated in a manner that protects against flooding and environmental degradation from landslides All of these are part of going green 

	IBHS also firmly believes that adaptation is critical, not only to reduce long-term property insurance losses, but to buttress individual and societal resilience All of the property protection measures that IBHS advocates to strengthen structures against current weather threats will also reduce future losses caused by climate change events And, the unprecedented scientific research conducted at the unique IBHS Research Center is critical to identification of new mitigation actions that may help protect against more severe weather events 

	Additionally, research conducted by IBHS will help to make sure that green building enhancements do not inadvertently cause structures to be less disaster-resistant, or even worse, threaten the life safety of occupants or first respondersfor example, photovoltaic arrays that take flight or pose fire suppression challenges are the antithesis of building strong 

As a building science institute, and due to antitrust concerns, IBHS does not have access to, and cannot compile, a list of market-based discounts offered by specific insurers with respect to current or future weather scenarios That said, IBHS research helps its member companies to better understand structural vulnerability and the role that mitigation plays in reducing damage from severe weather, as well as what mitigation features to look for when inspecting a residential or commercial building 

A few states (Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, and South Carolina) have developed legislative or regulatory discount frameworks for homes built or retrofitted to the code-plus, hazard-specific FORTIFIED new construction and retrofit standards developed by IBHS 

In these states, the Institute has worked with insurance regulators and insurance companies to make sure that the discount programs work as they were intended upon enactment, and actually facilitate risk-based pricing, which can serve both to encourage effective mitigation and discourage unsound development in disaster-prone areas 

The quickest way for individual property owners to find out if their residential or commercial building qualifies for an incentive (for example, by meeting the designation requirements of the FORTIFIED program) is to ask their insurance department or company  In addition to discounts, insurance incentives related to mitigation may include a positive decision by an underwriter to provide coverage in the voluntary, rather than through the residual, market, lower deductibles, or more favorable coverage terms relating to post-disaster claims payments Again, these are business decisions made by individual insurers, and IBHS neither influences such decisions nor specifically tracks them

Merit Life Insurance Co.,  Climate change risk is not relevant to these relationships given the nature of our business,6
California Casualty Insurance Company,"  We will continue to mitigate our risks (eg, not writing homeowner policies in coastal states) as they emerge  

California Casualty models a number of perils (fire-following EQ, tornado/hail, winter storm, and hurricane) which could be affected by climate change  However, these models do not reflect the effects of climate change in the probabilistic results Given our geographical diversification and premium volume, we dont expect that climate change will have a material impact on the way we structure our catastrophe reinsurance program

Climate change, including global warming and sea-level rise, is expected to result in increased annual variability in weather-related events, including wildfires, convective storms, winter storms, hurricanes and floods   Damage resulting from such events is generally covered by policies underwritten by California Casualty members and California Casualty has instituted a number of methods to limit its exposure to such losses, including  the following:
1	Product Distribution 
a	Auto-only in Florida, Mississippi, Louisiana, South Carolina and Texas
2	Underwriting 
a	Minimum distance-to-coast underwriting acceptability rules for Property risks located in Alabama, Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, New Jersey, Rhode Island, and Virginia
b	Use of ISO FireLine to qualify new Property risks in Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Oregon, Utah,   Washington and Wyoming 
3	Pricing 
a	Effective 4/1/2014, rates are varied by ISO FireLine scores in California
b	Rates are varied by roof age  Effective dates vary by state
c	Introduced higher deductible options
d	Starting from 4/1/2014, the company has been rolling out new by-peril rating plans for homeowners policies Based on the current schedule, by the end of this year, 24 states will have this plan, which represent 95% of the homeowners policies 

4	Data Quality
a	Property risks at 6/30/16 were modeled with the following geo-coding accuracy:
      Parcel                   952%
      Street Address      42%
      Postal Code            6%
5	Monitoring exposure concentration
a	RMS Terrorism analysis used as surrogate for non-modeled perils, such as wildfire or riot & civil commotion
b	Coastal exposures are monitored on a regular basis

Energy - At USAA we care about energy conservation and have made significant strides, including the following: 
¿	From 2017 to 2018, the Home Office Campus yielded a 12% energy reduction despite the increased energy demand from our datacenter operations 
¿	In 2016, to supplement its electricity resources, USAA purchased or self-generated more than 23% of the San Antonio and Phoenix campuses electrical power from renewable energy This amount is roughly equal to the energy needed to power more than 2,300 average-sized San Antonio homes 
¿	In 2015, nearly one-fourth of USAAs electricity usage came from purchased or generated renewable energy sources, including wind power This includes a 1 MW solar array that we built at our Phoenix campus 
¿	The San Antonio, Phoenix, Tampa, and Colorado Springs office facilities have all earned the prestigious ENERGY STAR rating from the EPA for more than 10 years 
¿	Our San Antonio, Phoenix, Tampa, and Colorado Springs office facilities have all received certificates for Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) The LEED Green Building Rating System is the internationally recognized green building certification system for the design, construction and operation of high-performance green buildings 

Recycling - Our recycling program helps conserve energy and raw materials, reduces manufacturing pollution and also reduces the burden on landfills Accomplishments of the program include:

¿	In 2018 the Enterprise recycled over 88 million pounds in 2018, that is a diversion rate of 58%
¿	2018 diversion rate includes more than 881 tons of obsolete electronic equipment, 1400 tons of landscape material and 781 tons of furniture 
¿	Our café kitchens composted 13 tons of food waste in 2018 
¿	In 2018, more than 58 percent of USAA members have switched to online documents instead of receiving statements and notifications by mail 
¿	Since 2011, USAA has sponsored employee recycling events in the Spring and Fall at our San Antonio, Phoenix, Colorado Springs, Chesapeake and Plano Offices The purpose of the event is to provide Enterprise sponsored time and convenience for employees to recycle their personal electronic devices and confidential documents at no charge in a safe and environmentally responsible manner  In 2018, almost 900 employees participated in the events to divert more than 77,000 pounds of electronics and paper from the landfill  
Air Quality - We work to limit our air quality impact in everything from the chemicals used in our facilities to employee commuting and fleet vehicle emissions Examples include:
¿	Encourage employee use of vanpool, public transit, biking and carpooling through amenities such as bike racks, lockers, designated vanpool/carpool parking and USAA Rideshare a digital ridematch platform and incentive program for USAA employees
¿	Landscape contractors use alternative fuel mowers
¿	Using ""green cleaning"" products to protect health without harming the environment 

Water - USAA recognizes the role we play in conserving precious water resources Examples include:
¿	Since 2004 the San Antonio Corporate Office has utilized recycled water for its landscape irrigation, saving on average 70 million gallons a year of Edwards Aquifer water In late 2018, the Home Office Campus applied the use of recycled water for its cooling tower operations; thereby restoring an additional 60 million gallons of water annually to the Edwards Aquifer 
¿	Replacing high-flow toilets and shower heads with low-flow fixtures and installing sink aerators to reduce fresh water use by more than six million gallons annually
¿	Using drought-tolerant plants and retention ponds to capture storm water

The companies do not have a formal plan to assess and reduce emissions in their operations, but do informally maintain an awareness of energy usage and related emissions Torchmark desires to be a responsible citizen of the communities it inhabits and to be a good steward of natural and monitory resources  With those goals in mind, Torchmark management has emphasized energy conservation through various upgrades to the McKinney TX building systems, IT/Computer systems and employee awareness initiatives Some of those initiatives are  

Building Utilities (specifically electricity consumption) 

	Replaced a cooling tower in the building in 2009 with a new high efficiency variable speed unit which uses less electricity and water
	Added timers and programmable set back controllers to control HVAC systems which allow us to turn off cooling during non-business hours and during winter when cooling demands are less
	Utilize lower wattage high efficiency fluorescent lighting in all areas
	All PCs and network copiers/printers are set to auto-sleep mode
	As CRT monitors fail, they are replaced with Energy Star rated LCD monitors
	Employee awareness  encourage all employees to conserve energy both at work and at home
	Light fixtures in the building are on switches that are programmed to turn off if there is inactivity in the area
	Trees and landscaping around the perimeter of the buildings are designed to shade the building to reduce cooling loads
	Torchmark has replaced our physical IT server environment with a virtualized server environment This upgrade to IT systems is expected to reduce electricity usage

Recycling  

	We monitor print and are committed to reducing the amount of print generated in our operations through the use of electronic communications and reporting We also work to identify print that can be eliminated or reduced
	Paper correspondence received is imaged and filed electronically This allows us to recycle virtually all of the paper received or produced
	Recycling was a focus in the design and materials used in the new building For example, the terrazzo flooring in the new building is made from recycled porcelain plumbing fixtures and the carpeting was manufactured by InterfaceFLOR using 25% post consumer or bio based materials 
	Personal hygiene products used in the restroom facilities are manufactured from recycled or renewable resource paper products

Water Conservation  
	All of the fixtures in the McKinney Texas restroom facilities are low flow fixtures
	Landscaping has been designed using primarily low maintenance native plants to reduce water consumption Sprinkler systems are on timers

General  
	The company encourages employees to remain on site and conserve fuel by providing an employee lunch room in which local restaurants cater in lunch

Medco Containment Insurance Company of New York," While there is not a specific climate change policy, at the company level, our Corporate Responsibility team maintains daily strategic oversight to identify and manage company-level risks related to climate change that may impact our business Cross-functional perspectives from our Cigna Connects Corporate Responsibility Governance Council assist in the identification of company-wide market risks and opportunities related to climate change Our Cigna Connects Corporate Responsibility Governance Council contains representation from Cignas Risk Management and Global Real Estate teams 

Our Risk Management team facilitates a formal, quarterly review process for business stakeholders to identify and assess physical, regulatory and business risks which includes, but is not limited to, energy and natural resources pricing, supply chain, and business continuity risks that could be on the horizon Environmental risk, including risk drivers associated with climate change, is now an explicit risk within Cignas enterprise risk register Environmental risks are formally reviewed annually for relevance and accuracy and updates on how the company is managing each environmental risk are provided on a quarterly basis 

Any material risks are shared with Enterprise Risk Management and business leaders in addition to being reported up through the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors Additionally, our Corporate Real Estate team utilizes a proprietary technology data management portal and Utility Insight, to assist in the ongoing identification on climate change risks and opportunities in the overall real estate portfolio

At the asset level, our Corporate Real Estate Sustainability Manager oversees our Inventory Management Program with the support of our Senior Director of Corporate Responsibility  We conduct a quarterly review process of energy consumption and emissions data for our portfolio Our international properties, which currently comprise 6% of our portfolio floor area, are reviewed annually The results of this process are incorporated into quarterly enterprise-level risk reports that are presented to Enterprise Risk Management for inclusion in overall ERM reporting to the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors

Cigna conducts risk identification and evaluation with respect to current and prospective investments Climate change is one of the many risks that are considered Cignas general account investment portfolio consists predominately of fixed-income assets While the primary risks Cigna undertakes are credit related, climate change can play a role in our evaluation of the creditworthiness of specific issuers and industries Potential risk factors include: 
 Changes in regulatory requirements (eg, emissions controls); 
 Changes in supply/demand for fuel (eg, oil, natural gas); 
 Developments in renewable energy sources; and
 Effects of extreme weather events on industries and issuers 

Climate change may impact certain investments For example, commercial real estate may become less desirable due to climate change factors such as global warming, rising sea levels or hurricane activity This could adversely affect a property's value as collateral for a commercial mortgage loan Climate changes can influence the inflation outlook and/or creditworthiness of specific emerging market issuers (eg a reduction in rainfall can cause food prices to rise, increasing inflation)

Victoria National Insurance Company,"  NWIs primary responsibility is to adhere to the investment and compliance policies established by its clients In accordance with the investment policies of the clients, NWI has a duty to assess the risks and opportunities of potential and current investments, which include those arising from climate change Therefore, NWIs credit research team considers both climate change and environmental regulations and disclosures along with many other factors in its assessment of the business risks and opportunities of all current and potential investments NWI also considers the effects of legislative action at the portfolio level when allocating funds across asset classes
The potential long-term effects of climate change are considered in a number of ways across the asset classes where NWI actively invests on behalf of its clients Some examples:
	For real estate/commercial mortgage loan investments, the potential impact of climate change factors into the evaluation/underwriting process by considering, among other things, proximity to coastal areas and increased risk of tropical storm damage, and the current water shortages that exist in the Western states
	For municipal bond investments, the ability of the bond issuer (ie municipality) to repay debt is largely influenced by the health of its local economy and stability of its population (tax) base Climate change issues ranging from water scarcity in the Southwest to coastal migration in Florida are considered when evaluating potential investments
	For corporate bond and equity investments, we review a companys policy and practice to manage climate change and environmental risks in order to assess their potential impact on overall credit worthiness We also actively monitor industry sectors that are more sensitive to climate change and environmental risks

When assessing and managing all of these risks, we consider overall company financial exposure, including insured coverage, not just investment risk

Part B:  The more specific answer is ""No, not specifically in connection with climate change""  See response to first part of Question 5  As previously stated, NWI employs a comprehensive underwriting philosophy and approach that, among other things, includes assessing risks and opportunities that arise from climate change  This is a constant process that is enhanced and refined over time based upon the investment and economic environment",4

The Cincinnati Casualty Company," As a result, insured losses for our property casualty insurance business would adversely affect our financial performance and condition if the level of losses we experience over a period of time were to exceed our actuarially determined expectations 

Our property lines of business are the most exposed and we are actively expanding our geographic footprint to areas of the US that have a different or reduced catastrophe loss potential Extreme weather could also prevent our associates ability to perform necessary operational functions, such as processing new and renewal policies and claims Our ability to access our headquarters facilities or a failure of technology, communications or other systems could significantly impair our ability to perform such functions on a timely basis or affect the accuracy of transactions If sustained or repeated, such business interruption or system failure could result in a deterioration of our ability to write and process new and renewal business, serve our agents and policyholders, pay claims in a timely manner, collect receivables or perform other necessary business functions An unusually severe event could also trigger reinsurer insolvencies and/or could have more wide-spread economic and market impacts 

We have considered liquidity needs and the impacts of catastrophes coupled with market events triggered by the catastrophe that could cause investment losses and reduced liquidity  We consider risks both over short time horizons and their impact to surplus and over a thirty year time horizon, evaluating impacts on distributable cash flows 

Changes in regulation on climate change issues affecting the insurance industry could increase our cost of doing business or could restrict our ability to conduct business Regulatory changes could cause unexpected and unintended issues related to insurance pricing, claims and coverage These issues may adversely affect our business by impeding our ability to obtain adequate rates for covered risks, extending coverage beyond underwriting intent or by increasing the number or size of claims

Climate change may increase both the frequency and severity of claims or the cost of defending such claims AIG PC policies are primarily written for periods of 12 months, providing AIG PC with the ability to modify underwriting practices and pricing procedures; limiting the financial impact of such increase in claims Each line of business and many individual policyholders may have different exposures to the effects of climate change

The strength of AIGs diverse and global franchise helps manage risks efficiently by limiting the economic impact of any single event and by contributing to a relatively stable risk profile overall However, AIG monitors natural catastrophe exposures on an ongoing basis and, through the AIG PC Environmental Working Group, is examining the latest climate science to better understand how climate change may potentially impact the frequency and severity of future extreme weather events

OHIO INDEMNITY COMPANY,"  We do, however, engage in and encourage informal measures, and our office is located in a designated ""Green Spot"" building that is committed to green environmental initiatives such as reduce, reuse, and recycle programs, and water and energy conservation",0
Pacific Indemnity Company," This strategy utilizes our expertise in identifying and managing risk and providing solutions The strategic plan focuses on the management of our operations and it is multifaceted, with elements concentrating on emissions from our facilities, fleet and travel management, paper reduction and related communication activities to key constituencies These are discussed in more detail below 

Many areas across Chubb are involved in the plan and its execution The areas include the Corporate Responsibility Office, the Chief Risk Officer, Administrative Services, the Strategic Business Units, Claims and other functional departments Recognizing the importance of environmental stewardship to our employees and other stakeholders, in 2013 we created the Corporate Responsibility Office to better coordinate and communicate our corporate citizenship activities, including our emissions reduction efforts In addition to working closely with the areas listed above, the office encourages and supports the formation of local cross-functional teams focused on reducing energy usage, paper usage and/or other initiatives to reduce our environmental impact

Annual emissions reduction and mitigation actions:
As part of our business operations, we have an annual planning process that includes emissions reduction and mitigation activities
As a result, since 2008 in the facilities we manage in the United States, we have:
	Reduced our Scope 1 and 2 emissions by almost 18% 
	Reduced electric consumption in corporate facilities by over 19% 
	Reduced natural gas consumption in corporate facilities by over 30% 

In 2013, our corporate global headquarters and two other buildings we own received Energy Star Certification

On a monthly basis, we recycle desk-side paper, secured shredded paper, glass, plastic, corrugated (cardboard), batteries, lamps, lamp housing or fixtures, ballasts, thermostats, aluminum, tin, copper, other metals, fryer grease, carpet, refrigerant, oil, diesel, paint, asphalt, chemicals, used equipment and motors On a seasonal basis, we recycle grass clippings, leaves, tree branches and stumps

In our offices we deploy:
	A Green Cleaning Program using cleaning materials which are certified green by Green Seal, Inc
	Paper towels with recycled or post-consumer waste content
	Coreless toilet paper to reduce cardboard roll waste (all New Jersey sites)
	Air fresheners that contain low or no Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) (all New Jersey locations)
	No or low VOC paint
	No or low VOC chemicals when applicable
	New office furniture (desks, chairs, tables, filing cabinets etc) with recycled content, post-consumer or post-industrial waste (when needed)
	New carpet with recycled content (when needed)
	No or low VOC carpet adhesive
	New ceiling tiles (USG 450 White Frost) with over 50% recycled content and that have zero emissions (when needed, global headquarters location)
	Environmentally friendly roadway de-icing pellets (Whitehouse Station, NJ, location)

Energy savings for those buildings we lease and/or manage are achieved by:
	Conducting energy audits
	Having the HVAC (heating, ventilation and air conditioning) equipment and systems retro-commissioned
	Replacing failed appliances with Energy Star certified appliances (hot water heaters, refrigerators, dish washing machines)
	Replacing all failed motors with more energy efficient models (when applicable), and controlling motors by Variable Frequency Drives (VFDs) to modulate the motor speed based on need 
	Replacing heating and cooling units with more energy efficient units 
	Using building automation systems to efficiently operate lighting and HVAC systems based on need

As we renovate or relocate our non-owned/managed offices around the globe, we seek ways to reduce our environmental footprint For example, when we relocated our Atlanta branch in 2013, the corporate real estate team selected space in a LEED Silver certified building The building's certification was based on its proximity and shuttle service to MARTA, the local public transportation system; an on-site bank and restaurant; shuttle service to nearby shopping; a 3,500-square-foot training facility, which enables tenants to reduce their space requirements; and a building energy management system We designed the space with several environmental-friendly elements in mind By leaving part of the ceiling exposed, polishing concrete floors and leaving columns unfinished, we were able to reduce our consumption of carpeting, drywall and other materials Locating offices on the interior of the floor also reduced material usage and enabled us to take advantage of natural light and airflow, and the installation of efficient workstations helped minimize our square footage requirements 

Telecommuting:
	Chubb offers employee telecommuting and compressed work weeks Approximately 15% of our US based workforce teleworks 1 or more days per week In addition, approximately 3% of the US workforce is on a compressed work schedule

Fleet and Travel Management:
	We transitioned to a four-cylinder fleet in 2011 Each vehicle is replaced at 45,000 miles The overall fleet benefits from continuous improvements in fuel economy and carbon reduction technology, which has further improved GHG benefits by reducing the total carbon in 2013 another 25%, the equivalent of removing eighteen vehicles from the fleet
	In 2010, we introduced a policy encouraging employees to rent a car for all daily business trips in excess of 150 miles  The rental vehicles offered are 4-cylinder, thus limiting usage of personal cars, which may be SUVs, trucks or 6- or 8-cylinder sedans  In 2013, 75% of rentals were for four-cylinder vehicles 
	As of year-end 2013, nearly 1,300 Chubb travelers opted in to receive electronic copies, instead of paper copies, of hotel folios  
	As part of our annual hotel RFP process, Chubb Travel Services has made a concerted effort to partner with suppliers who have strong corporate responsibility and sustainability programs and projects  One major hotel chain partner has experienced a 9% reduction in energy consumption, and has lowered GHG emissions by 10% and water consumption by 7% 

Paper reduction:
	Paperless initiatives in all three Strategic Business Units, Claims, Billing and HR, combined saved over 15 million sheets of paper of paper in 2013 Examples include:
¿	100% of Chubb agents who write commercial direct bill business (where customers are billed and remit premiums directly to Chubb) review monthly commission statements on line 
¿	Chubb's Agency Bill agents are divided between those that submit a report of premiums due to us versus those that receive from us a statement of premiums due  90% of agents submitting a report of premiums due to us do so electronically while 100% of those receiving a statement of premiums due receive that statement electronically 
¿	Premium Accounting's Legal Collections unit serves as the liaison between Chubb and a number of outside collection agencies who are assigned premiums to collect on our behalf when internal collection efforts have been exhausted  100% of the communications between Chubb and those outside firms takes place electronically and all internal records are maintained in a paperless environment
¿	Premium Accounting has seen a 85% reduction in the receipt of paper checks in its bank lock box utilized for national brokers  Paper check receipts in 2013 totaled 5,000 while we project 800 paper checks received for 2014  Payments are instead being electronically wire transferred directly into Chubb's account
¿	988% of our payroll advices are online
¿	Personal Lines customers have the option to receive their policy electronically 
¿	Commercial Lines customers can remit payments over the phone or online
¿	98% of the documentation Personal Lines sends to agents and brokers in the US is done so electronically
¿	62% of our Commercial Lines agents are enrolled in our paper-free program 
¿	100% of all new claims are now digitized and stored/archived electronically 
¿	In 2013, the Claim Department completed full deployment of a document management system that digitizes all physical incoming claim mail  During 2013, more than one million electronic documents were digitized, rather than printed, by the Claim Department 

We recognize that our customers, employees and other key stakeholders are increasingly interested in our sustainability efforts, including with respect to emissions reduction, and an area of focus for the Corporate Responsibility Office is communicating our efforts  One of the Corporate Responsibility Offices first actions was to launch an internal social media site to communicate our actions, to engage employees and to share recommendations on managing and reducing environmental impact at the office and at home  The site launch included a video featuring the President of Personal Lines and Claims discussing the importance corporate responsibility at Chubb

We provide updates on our plans and progress toward meeting goals in our response to the CDP, as well as periodically on wwwchubbcom and through customer communications For example, we send communications to our personal lines policyholders to encourage them to make the world a greener place by enrolling in our paperless option - ePolicy",0

Victoria Automobile Insurance Company," Included within these risk mitigation efforts is the application of fortified standards developed by the Insurance Institute for Business and Home Safety (IBHS) As part of this program, mitigation credits can be earned by our customers thus reducing the premium we charge along with reducing the potential future losses due to weather-type events Nationwide also offers a home inventory process that allows consumers the ability to track their personal belongings for when an unfortunate event occurs Nationwide mailed information to 55,000 of our members in high wildfire hazard areas in Western states in the Spring of 2015 The mailing provided them with a website and information from IBHS on how to make their homes and businesses safer from wildfire  Nationwide believes that proper hazard mitigation is an effective way to address the increasing threat from wildfire  We are in the process of re-inspecting our portfolio and making risk reduction recommendations to our members on how to mitigate their wildfire hazard

In addition, to continue driving more awareness around the benefits from risk mitigation, Nationwide is implementing a new endorsement focused on replacing roofs according to the different IBHS standards at the time of an eligible loss which will result in a more weather-proofed roof IBHS guidance for mitigating property losses is available directly to the public at wwwdisastersafetyorg Increased risk sharing through the utilization of wind/hail deductibles is also being implemented to help encourage consumers to proactively mitigate weather claims In addition, Nationwide is active at the local and national level to help drive the necessary building code changes to make homes safer Nationwide is an active member of the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) Wildland and Rural Fire Protection committee This is a committee that develops codes, standards, and recommended practices for fire protection infrastructure used in land development in wildland, rural, and suburban areas

As catastrophe risk increases in certain markets, Nationwide continues to invest in the necessary tools to better understand the risk, whether it be hurricanes, severe thunderstorms or wildfires Financially, the importance of geographic diversification within Nationwides portfolio is one of the key levers to being a successful property insurer Included within this work is the integration of risk management findings into pricing, product development and distribution planning along with consumer education

Along similar lines, Nationwide constructed one of the first ever commercial buildings in San Antonio that is certified as fortified according to IBHS standards and we have also built a second office building to those standards in downtown Columbus The company continues to not only help drive these types of changes within the community but across the different businesses In partnership with home builders, banks, consumers, IBHS and legislatures, the necessary changes will need to occur leading to improvements in building codes and risk management in general

From a commercial standpoint, Nationwide provides education and loss control services to assist customers in identifying risks, ways to mitigate risks along with including exclusionary language for certain risk types within its contracts Through individual risk pricing modifications, those consumers who respond to these services in a positive manner could be eligible for improved pricing considerations

CompBenefits Company,"  Humana is committed to integrating green building principles into our existing and new portfolio of facilities with a focus on energy and water efficiency Humana advanced this objective through the integration of climate and sustainability factors such as energy efficiency projects at our facilities, access to transportation, Energy Star or LEED ranking, employee engagement (ie, behavioral change) and other parameters, into the decision criteria used to improve our facility portfolio and select future Humana locations  Opportunities for improving the portfolio and achieving energy and GHG reduction goals are identified by the Workplace Solutions team in collaboration with our external consulting partners  Initiatives may be evaluated and presented to the senior management for support and funding including capital investment, associate involvement (ie, resource support) or other requirements  

Humanas short-term strategy (<3 years) is influenced by climate change most notably with regard to our environmental goals, set to expire at the end of 2017 These goals influence our team to focus on energy efficient operations, spurring direct investment in resources, both financial and personnel, to focus on climate change mitigation within our owned and leased facilities These investments have enabled Humana to implement a portfolio-wide LED lighting retrofit program and other projects to increase the efficient use of energy at our facilities In addition, our design standards team, architect and engineering consultants, and facilities team collaborated in 2016 to develop a comprehensive set of design standards for office and clinical operations to ensure consistency, energy efficiency, and sustainable practices across new builds and renovations Overall, our facility portfolio efforts have resulted in over $18MM in cost savings, 65,000 MMBtu in energy reduction, and nearly 11,000 mt CO2e GHG reduction  Finally, ongoing workspace optimization efforts increase workspace density while also decreasing building vacancies, thereby reducing our physical footprint and alleviating commute burden to reduce energy usage and emissions

On the whole, energy use reduction and greenhouse gas emissions reduction efforts not only drive progress toward our sustainability goals, but also illustrate to our employees and customers our commitment to reduce GHG emissions and operate as efficiently as possible Employee engagement efforts include a continuing focus on increasing work from home with the understanding that this strategy will have a significant impact on Scope 3 emissions, while providing our workforce greater flexibility and reducing operational demands of our facilities By the end of 2015, nearly 50,000 sq ft of traditional space was converted to agile work space at eight locations, while 34% of Humanas employees worked from home by the end of 2016

Our long-term strategy (generally considered to be 5-10 years) is impacted by potential consequences of climate change such as regulation, natural resource scarcity, facility operational costs and human health impacts Our Workplace Solutions leaders review short- and long-term trends and impacts associated with sustainability and refine our business strategy accordingly For example, Humana's portfolio includes both owned and leased assets where many facility investments are on a long-term basis (up to 10 years) Our sustainable real estate approach ensures these investments take into consideration the long-term impacts of building characteristics on climate change and overall environmental impact, employee wellness, and operational costs

Foremost Property and Casualty Insurance Company,"  Regulatory risks as diverse as insurance regulatory obligations, emissions caps, base load management requirements, and building code requirements could impact the insurance business  Regulation, as well, can have the unintended consequence of masking risk based price signals and could cause stakeholders to increase climate related risk  rather than manage and reduce such risks  For example, subsidizing property insurance premiums, or flood insurance premiums or providing insurance or agreements to re-build in regularly eroded coastal locations or high risk fire areas could cause increase of building in such locations in a manner economically inconsistent with the physical risks presented by climate change

Regulatory uncertainty and regulation that is not economically well-grounded can create additional risk for both insurers and society  Even where public policies are well grounded in sound economic policy, multi-state and nationally active insurers will likely be required to address potentially disparate and conflicting climate policies and rules and bear the associated costs 

These generally complex issues involving the interplay of new requirements within existing legal structures create unique risks; results of the same public policy will likely be different when applied in different jurisdictions - unless the results of interplay are completely and accurately analyzed in the development of such policy

Potential unintended negative consequences of regulatory action could pose a challenge for the industry, such as where the true economic cost of new legislation has not been well thought through or where the new legislation results in a disproportionate allocation of costs of climate related risk  In addition, competing requirements could mean that compliance in one jurisdiction may not satisfy other jurisdictions, thus creating duplicative or additive expenditures in the development of adaptive risk management solutions without demonstrable economic or social benefit  Additionally, regulatory actions may restrict a company from making needed changes to its pricing or prompt litigation which could put a financial strain on the organization

As the insurance industry faces regulatory risk, they face legal risk as well  Climate-related legislation that is not well-crafted may create incentives for law suits in some jurisdictions  Even in the absence of new laws, there have already been and may continue to be attempts to use existing laws to bring more climate change-related litigation against sovereign entities and companies in particular sectors 

With respect to an insurers own operations and physical facilities, regulatory initiatives relating to emissions limits, transportation, water and energy use could impact office planning, employee commuting patterns and general resource usage  Within Farmers, activities to help respond to these trends have begun, including telecommuting, meetings held via phone, video and webinar, recycling and other environmentally-friendly practices

Farmers also has exposure to physical risks of climate change with respect to its own operations and as a result of exposures of its insureds assumed by Farmers though insurance policies  As outlined in the previous section, the physical risks impacting Farmers customers, as a result of climate change, may generate higher volatility in claims

A growing consensus among climate change experts suggests that changing weather patterns present risks of concern related to climate change  Direct impacts such as increased frequency and severity of precipitation events, droughts, wildfire are among the multiplicity of potential conditions that could impact ultimate loss events for insureds  The risk of these events could also pose a financial strain on the organization  Improved resilience and customers risk management actions continue to be significant foci of Farmers  The potential indirect physical and public health impact, such as increased frequency of widespread disease events and localized food and water shortages, may also affect many areas of property and casualty and life insurance  Such physical risks have both obvious and subtle consequences for insurers  These vulnerabilities, risks, and consequences are considered as an integrated part of the underwriting process in a manner appropriate given the tenor of the insurance instrument and the manifestation of variability, risk management vulnerability reductions and impacts

With regard to the insurers' own operations or investments, insurers, like their customers, have facilities and operations that are exposed to physical risks of climate change described above  Climate change (severe drought) may drive people/employees away from California, which could be damaging to a Southern California based company

Brighthouse Life Insurance Company of NY," Examples include restrictions on employee travel, or power outages disrupting operations and services While such impacts can result in revenue loss or damage brand value, the distributive nature of Brighthouse Financials organizational structure aids in reducing its vulnerability to acute near-term physical risks Where impacts to one node can temporarily disrupt operations, the magnitude of this impact would be limited by the companys ability to rely on alternative service providers and facilities

Specific to downstream operations, relevant business units are working to address climate risk exposure across the companys investment portfolios, including chronic, medium-to-long term physical risks to tangible assets (where physical damages to real estate assets may result in devaluations) and transition risks associated with carbon-intensive assets (where growth in alternative technologies may negatively impact a held assets financial performance)

Victoria Specialty Insurance Company,"  Included within these risk mitigation efforts is the application of fortified standards developed by the Insurance Institute for Business and Home Safety (IBHS)  As part of this program, mitigation credits can be earned by our customers thus reducing the premium we charge along with reducing the potential future losses due to weather-type events   Nationwide also offers a home inventory process that allows consumers the ability to track their personal belongings for when an unfortunate event occurs  Nationwide mailed information to 55,000 of our members in high wildfire hazard areas in Western states in the Spring of 2015  The mailing provided them with a website and information from IBHS on how to make their homes and businesses safer from wildfire
In addition, to continue driving more awareness around the benefits from risk mitigation, Nationwide is implementing a new endorsement focused on replacing roofs according to the different IBHS standards at the time of an eligible loss which will result in a more weather-proofed roof  IBHS guidance for mitigating property losses is available directly to the public at wwwdisastersafetyorg 
Increased risk sharing through the utilization of wind/hail deductibles is also being implemented to help encourage consumers to proactively mitigate weather claims  In addition, Nationwide is active at the local and national level to help drive the necessary building code changes to make homes safer    Nationwide is an active member of the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) Wildland and Rural Fire Protection committee  This is a committee that develops codes, standards, and recommended practices for fire protection infrastructure used in land development in wildland, rural, and suburban areas
As catastrophe risk increases in certain markets, Nationwide continues to invest in the necessary tools to better understand the risk, whether it be hurricanes, severe thunderstorms or wildfires  Financially, the importance of geographic diversification within Nationwides portfolio is one of the key levers to being a successful property insurer  Included within this work is the integration of risk management findings into pricing, product development and distribution planning along with consumer education
Along similar lines, Nationwide constructed one of the first ever commercial buildings in San Antonio that is certified as fortified according to IBHS standards and we have also built a second office building to those standards in downtown Columbus  The company continues to not only help drive these types of changes within the community but across the different businesses  In partnership with home builders, banks, consumers, IBHS and legislatures, the necessary changes will need to occur leading to improvements in building codes and risk management in general
From a commercial standpoint, Nationwide provides education and loss control services to assist customers in identifying risks, ways to mitigate risks along with including exclusionary language for certain risk types within its contracts  Through individual risk pricing modifications, those consumers who respond to these services in a positive manner could be eligible for improved pricing considerations

With respect to current holdings in agriculture, timber and real estate, individual investment teams have engaged key constituencies affecting their sector as follows:
	The Agriculture team has an ongoing dialogue with our external clients to engage on the issue of climate change and farmland portfolio impacts and strategy The Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) Advisory Council for our third-party farmland investment vehicle regularly reviews ESG activities within the portfolio We engage internal and external stakeholders on the topic of climate change through our annual Responsible Investment in Farmland report, which is publicly available We also regularly consult external subject-matter experts and engage with local, regional, and global non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to inform and guide our thinking and approach on the topic of climate change 
	Our timberland team is committed to maintaining environmental quality in its forestry operations and is recognized for its best-practice forest stewardship programs and techniques TIAA requires compliance with local laws and environmental regulations We actively encourage proactive interactions by the timberland team with relevant local stakeholders and identification and implementation of environmental enhancement opportunities The timberland team is also active as speakers at timberland and sustainable investment conferences to interact and share perspectives with other interested parties and stakeholders
	The Nuveen Real Estate sustainability program has facilitated engagement with clients, investors, residents, tenants, employees and industry peers through direct contact, marketing campaigns and national platforms such as the Department of Energys Better Buildings Challenge, where TIAA has provided multiple implementation models and showcase projects, to demonstrate actions and processes to help others reduce their exposure to climate risk Nuveen Real Estate provides transparency to investors on ESG strategy and performance and issues an enterprise-wide real estate investments ESG report on an annual basis, including the GA, TIAA Real Estate Account, and all Nuveen-managed third party funds Nuveen Real Estate reports to the Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmark (GRESB) framework and discloses ESG key performance indicators to investors
Through our proprietary impact framework within our Core Impact Bond strategies, we invest in projects and entities that directly benefit the environment, in keeping with our investment themes of Renewable Energy and Climate Change and Natural Resources As of the end of 2019, Core Impact Bond strategies invested over $3 billion in green bonds - bonds whose proceeds are earmarked to support environmentally beneficial projects or activities We continue to serve as an expert resource for both issuers and investment banks across fixed income sectors in how to structure, execute and report on environmentally beneficial deals  TIAA Investments served on the initial Executive Committee of the Green Bond Principles, which is working on developing voluntary guidelines for green bond issuance and impact reporting
Engagement with Portfolio Companies 
TIAA upholds the view that, as an institutional investor, we have a responsibility to foster long-term value creation through active ownership activities including direct dialogue with investee firms and proxy voting in public equities holdings  Our Nuveen Responsible Investing team implements this long-term perspective, in part, by communicating our view on material ESG matters, including the physical and transition risks from climate change and other salient factors that are likely to affect the long-term performance of individual companies and/or the broader market We encourage corporate managers and boards to carefully assess, manage, mitigate and disclose their ESG risks and opportunities along with robust, time-bound, and measurable ESG performance targets Ultimately, improvements in portfolio companies ESG performance is in our clients best economic interests as these measures help protect shareholder value 
In accordance with the TIAA Policy Statement on Responsible Investing, we recommend that managers in portfolio companies assess material climate-related risks and resource efficiency in operations, production processes, and supply chain management and that they publicly disclose meaningful data relevant to both  We consistently encourage companies that that are exposed to material physical or transition risks related to climate change to disclose the results of forward-looking climate risk scenario analysis, such as a scenario in which global average temperature rise is limited to two degrees Celsius or less above pre-industrial levels  We find that companies that evaluate the potential impacts of future climate scenarios on their key drivers of business performance are not only better prepared for the negative aspects of climate change but also are better able to identify potential opportunities stemming from the low carbon transition
Company disclosures should convey to shareholders how climate change may impact the companys long term business outlook, strategic planning and capital allocation decisions  
We believe that a companys board of directors is responsible for ensuring management accountability, assessing operational strategies and overseeing risk mitigation frameworks As part of this responsibility, we believe the board should guide the development of a strategic, long-term approach to addressing climate-change-related risks and hold management accountable for its implementation As such, we convey to board directors our expectations that they should readily engage with their management teams in developing corporate strategies and performance expectations to address climate-change-related risk  We underscore our expectation by emphasizing that all companies should adopt and report on relevant, science-based climate change management performance targets that are aligned with the Paris Agreement  
When voting on shareholder proposals related to global climate change issues, TIAA will generally support reasonable shareholder resolutions seeking disclosure of greenhouse gas emissions, the impact of climate change on a companys business activities and products, and strategies designed to reduce the companys long-term impact on global climate We supported 83% of climate change proposals in 2019

We are able to manage our overall exposure to risk by managing our underwriting guidelines, purchasing reinsurance, maintaining an adequate surplus, and working with our policyholders to ensure that they have the appropriate amount of insurance on their policies 

As knowledge of the factors that influence exposure to loss improves we are able to better refine our underwriting guidelines to ensure that we understand the risks posed by the exposures being written Factors such as roof type, distance to brush, hurricane shutters, and distance to the coast are all risk factors that differentiate the total exposure to loss 

The Exchange purchases reinsurance to ensure that we can meet the needs of our policyholders in the event of a major catastrophe A strong surplus position is another way that we have managed the risks posed by potential climate change 

Requiring that policyholders purchase adequate policy limits for their homes ensures not only that the company receives the correct amount of premium, but also that the policyholder can rebuild their home in the event of a total loss

Metropolitan Tower Life Insurance Company," MetLife recognizes that every individual and business faces economic, environmental and social risks including: natural disasters, liability loss, accidents, reputation damage and interruption of business Climate change and its associated effects may amplify many of these risks, but most significantly to insurance, climate change can impact the frequency and/or severity of hurricanes, tornadoes, and hail Climate change is expected to have its largest impact on the homeowners business  MetLife is a diversified company and its homeowners business represents under 3% of the enterprises 2014 premium 

The perils that climate change may impact most significantly are hurricanes, tornadoes, and hail so losses from these perils may increase due to climate change MetLife has long recognized the possibility of catastrophe losses varying significantly from expected amounts in a given year as a result of climate change In response, the Company has historically monitored, and continues to monitor, its spread of risk monthly  The Company writes in all 50 states and the District of Columbia  The Company identifies the geographic areas that could produce the largest catastrophe losses through both the analysis of exposure concentrations and the analysis of catastrophe models  Since catastrophe modeling is not exact, the Company reviews the results from three different independent catastrophe models Each modeler employs its own staff of experts that may include scientists, climatologists, actuaries, engineers, and statisticians as well as other disciplines  The Company reviews the catastrophe model results for five different hurricane zones
 
Modeling several hurricane zones helps identify the modelers current beliefs about how climate change may differ by zone  The Company reviews both the Long Term (historical record of hurricanes) and Near Term (representing the next five years of expected activity under a warm sea surface assumption) estimates, but manages to the more conservative Near Term estimates The Company evaluates potential losses from events that cause greater damage than observed historical events (eg, 1 in 100 year, 1 in 200 year, 1 in 250 year, 1 in 500 year, 1 in 1000 year, and 1 in 2000 year events) for each of the five hurricane zones along with their impact on surplus Year over year changes in each return periods estimates provide additional insight into how the modelers view the impact of climate change Of course, other impacts are reflected in the segmented geographic and various return period analysis as well, such as new knowledge pertaining to the quality of the construction due to building code changes The Company pays close attention to the impacts on liquidity and capital needs associated with each of the return period losses mentioned above The Company also reviews the latest published articles on climate change  

The Company continually reviews the possible impact of climate change on the reinsurance market and reinsurance costs The Company purchases catastrophe reinsurance such that the Near Term net post-tax losses from events with a conservative return period are less than a pre-determined percentage of surplus The Company plans reinsurance costs out three years into the future 

Finally, the Company follows a consistent process year after year re-evaluating the multi-model results, risk concentrations, and latest climate change science

In addition to the procedures outlined above, MetLife also assesses and includes climate change in risks considered in the Companys investment portfolio and business practices  One example of this monitoring is an Event Risk Analysis that is conducted semiannually by MetLife Real Estate Investors (MREI) The analysis reveals MREIs exposure to hurricanes and windstorms in respect to the geographic concentrations of the MetLife portfolio

Jefferson Natl Life Ins Co of NY,"S Nationwide and its subsidiaries write personal, agribusiness, main-street and middle-market commercial property casualty insurance, as well as life insurance and retirement solution products Nationwide stays abreast of the most recent scientific studies and findings with regard to climate change Currently, the consensus opinion by the scientific community on observed trends is that tropical cyclones, extropical cyclones (winter storms), and severe thunderstorms will increase in intensity while decreasing in frequency due to climate change Wildfires and floods are expected to increase in both intensity and frequency

Nationwide faces several potential business risks associated with climate change including:

	Potential volatility in results due to possible increased frequency and/or severity of weather-related catastrophic losses;
	Regulatory constraints on charging appropriate rates that take into account possible weather changes and related losses that are not reflected by historical statistics; 
	Market share of business being adversely impacted due to a disproportionate growth of population and property along coastal areas; 
	Catastrophic losses not limited to coastal areas potentially becoming more frequent (as in hurricane-related losses in the Midwest);
	Disparate impact of climate change on certain insured segments either directly (such as agriculture), or through regulation (eg heavy industry due to emissions) These insured segments could be significantly impacted which could in turn affect the companys business and
	Availability and cost of risk transfer options (Reinsurance, Cat Bonds, Cat Swaps, etc)
As we go to market with different initiatives, geographic diversification is one of the factors taken into consideration Additionally, Nationwide maintains sizable investment portfolios which might be impacted by climate change Therefore, consideration is given to the potential impacts of climate change on the investment portfolio
As many of these risks cross boundaries, the risk assessment needs to consider the correlation of the risk across the entire enterprise
Potentially Impacted Geographies: Nationwide companies have property exposures in all 50 states and the District of Columbia and the entire geography is subject to some potential consequence of climate change Nationwides Life and Retirement Solutions exposures also include all 50 states and the District of Columbia

Direct General Life Insurance Company," We monitor our exposure to potential catastrophe losses by using catastrophe models These models help us quantify the financial impact from potential hurricane, earthquake, earthquake fire-following, severe convective storm and winter weather events on a probabilistic basis We utilize these results to manage and purchase our catastrophe reinsurance program 
Additionally, we include the results of the catastrophe model in our internal economic capital model (ECM) Our ECM is a stochastic model used to quantify and analyze the financial impact and probability of occurrence of key risks faced by our company: underwriting risk, credit risk, interest rate risk and operational risk Weather-related events and losses from catastrophes are included within underwriting risk Through our ECM we have determined that weather-related events account for a significant portion of our potential capital requirements 
Furthermore, we include the effect of weather-related losses in our underwriting practices by attributing a percentage of losses due to weather-related events into our business planning We utilize model results and prior experience to estimate the financial impact from potential weather-related losses At an underwriting level, we manage our exposure to weather-related events by integrating catastrophe modeling tools in our underwriting practices, allowing us to leverage sophisticated models in our assessment of potential new business This includes assessing our exposure to wildfires, as well as, the aforementioned weather-related events

GEICO Secure Insurance Company,"  The Group includes several large subgroups of companies as well as a number of smaller subgroups and companies that operate independently While some of the larger subgroups own their own buildings and can thus have maximum control of their physical operations, many of the companies lease or rent the properties in which they operate, and therefore have less control of the physical aspects of their operations

Recycling of paper, glass and plastic are encouraged in all operations Reductions in energy usage are effected through the use of technology by encouraging electronic communication verses paper usage whenever available Imaging technology is used to replace paper usage and long term information storage Updating computer equipment regularly allows the Group to take advantage of newer technology, often reducing energy usage as well as adding more computing power while using less equipment Intelligent usage of energy is encouraged in all operations as a cost control issue as well as the positive impact that has for reducing the operational energy footprints

The two largest operational subgroups are General Reinsurance and GEICO  General Reinsurance has recently relocated its corporate headquarters in Stamford, CT, moving from an energy inefficient office environment, to an open floor design (no associates have offices, from the CEO on down) and specialized glass exterior that are energy efficient and result in cost savings to the company   

GEICO has the largest number of employees and physical operations among the Berkshire Hathaway group of insurance companies The following is GEICOs summary of their response to this question It serves as a model for its affiliates

GEICO is making significant strides in its Green initiatives, which includes measures to limit its greenhouse gas emissions The company has established green teams to focus on the issues and establish improvements The company encourages its associates to carpool, bike, or use public transportation, and it provides certain benefits to reduce the cost for its employees to use public transportation The company has increased its use of teleconferencing to reduce travel 

Here are several examples of changes implemented as a result of the green team efforts:

In GEICOs corporate headquarters it has eliminated all small departmental pantries and combined them into centralized pantries located strategically throughout the 600Ksf facility using strictly Energy Star approved appliances  More than 300 toasters were eliminated as well as toaster ovens, microwaves, portable and large refrigerators  The drastic reduction of appliances within the facility resulted in significant annual energy usage savings 

In a $2M+ project implemented in one of its regions, GEICO converted parking lot lighting from 400w metal halide to 255w LED  This region also switched from 32w T8 lamps to 25w T8 lamps on the production floors  100w metal halide lamps have been replaced by 20w LED in the stairwells

In an effort to reduce lighting to no more than the industry lighting levels GEICO removed lamps from 2x4 parabolic and other type of multi-lamp light fixtures where appropriate to conserve energy 

Many GEICO departments have implemented 2 sided printing versus printing on a single side of paper

One regional office installed a paper shredder in the vicinity of their loading dock to do its own shredding and bailing of paper

One regional office has solicited an energy consultant and the review and resulting changes implemented has resulted in significant electricity and natural gas usage savings

GEICO has continued to increase the number of four cylinder vehicles in its Corporate Fleet  Furthermore, the average number of gallons of gasoline purchased has been reduced and as a result the CO2 emissions have been reduced The company is exploring the use of diesel and hybrid vehicles to further reduce emissions The company is also increasing the use of van pools for employees

The use of non-volatile organic ingredients paint is preferred wherever possible within its facilities

GEICO has implemented water saving measures at its corporate headquarters by remodeling restrooms with water saving faucets, 16 gal flush toilets and 125 gal flush urinals  The faucets have preset temperature controls as well  Green biodegradable restroom paper products are being used in some offices

GEICO also promotes the use of technology to its customer base to reduce the amount of paper mail it sends It encourages its customers to transact business and receive information from the company via email and the internet, which reduces the paper footprint impact on the environment

The core of GEICOs green efforts are the establishment of both a Recycling Program and an Energy Report Card Furthermore, GEICO has made strides in reducing the impact that its Fleet has on the environment The Recycling Program is aimed at reducing the waste generation at all GEICO facilities, including proper disposal of all recyclable materials such as paper, aluminum cans and plastic bottles, ink toner cartridges, electronic waste, fluorescent bulbs, construction waste and rechargeable batteries GEICO further reduces its paper usage by double sided printing on all photocopiers and network printers

There are hundreds of office supply products that are made from recycled materials that GEICO procures and stocks for the entire company from a national supplier The frequency by which recycled material office supplies is used depends on the product being ordered

The Energy Report Card is aimed at administering best practices at all GEICO facilities to reduce energy consumption In its continuing efforts to conserve energy, GEICO has implemented the following changes in its corporate headquarters during the past year:

1)	Replaced two (2) 50+ year old centrifugal chillers with brand new centrifugal chillers  
2)	Replaced two (2) 50+ year old boilers with brand new boilers
3)	Replaced all 3M window film throughout the entire facility with 486,000 useable sf
4)	Replaced all mushroom parking lot lights with LED mushroom lights  This was in excess of 200 fixtures

Previous activities related to energy usage reduction relate to:

The use of a heat exchanger that takes advantage of free cooling in temperatures of 55 degrees Fahrenheit or less during the year

Installation of contemporary 2 megawatt emergency backup power generators equipped with the most advanced low NOX emissions equipment

Reduced demand for cooling power in data centers by both alternating the operation of redundant AC units and proactively sealing cable cutout holes that can save appreciably on the energy consumed for data center equipment asset cooling  A further measure to reduce energy consumption was to raise thermostat set points such that AC units runs less often while at the same time providing suitable cooling for the intended space

Installation of lighting controllers which permit powering down entire floors of facilities lighting during non-business hours

	Removing excess light bulbs in workspaces based upon National Illumination Society lighting standards

Replacing CRT computer monitors with flat screen monitor technology

Personal computers themselves are set to shut themselves off after a period of non-use (at night)

Copiers and printers are programmed to take advantage of sleep-mode inherent to the device when not in use

Deployment of new energy-wise vending machines

The following projects are in progress:

1)	Replaced the 20+ year old Building Automated System (BAS) that controls all HVAC throughout the facility  This Phase 1 projects to cut all main constant running AHU over to VFD technology to permit ramping up to the building HVAC load versus running continuously at full speed is 60% complete 
2)	Install window shades to compliment the window films ability to reject heat from the sun further reducing our cooling load on the building  This project will be completed in November

North American Elite Insurance Company,"swissrecom/rethinking/sustainable_energy/our_position_and_objectiveshtml) The governance process of the company's climate change activities includes various Group Executive Committee members and an annual presentation on Swiss Re's climate change strategy and activities is made to the Board of Director's Chairman's and Governance Committee  On a day-to-day basis the topic is managed by the Head Group Sustainability Risk  The Head Group Sustainability Risk and his team are responsible for implementing Swiss Re's climate change strategy and for coordinating the associated activities, and are the central point of communication for all climate-related inquiries from within and outside the company

Climate-related risks are systematically assessed during risk and underwriting process Priority is given to factors that could have the largest or most immediate financial impact, supplemented by research into climate change and its impacts Various units contribute to the assessment, including Group Sustainability Risk, which coordinates Swiss Re's climate change response Emerging Risk Management identifies and assesses new or emerging risks, including those climate related Catastrophe Perils unit designs and maintains loss models and supports the assessment of climate related risks as part of the underwriting process 

Swiss Re's property and casualty business is written using the four-eye principle: transactions must be approved by at least two authorized individuals  with the exception of single risk acceptances, which can be authorized by one underwriter, with the four-eye principle taken care of by spot checks after acceptance Each underwriter is assigned an individual underwriting authority based on technical skills and experience; any business exceeding this authority triggers a well-defined escalation process

Large individual transactions that could materially affect the Group's and Business Units risk exposure require independent review and sign-off by Risk Management before they can be authorized This is part of our three signature approval process (involving Swiss Re's underwriting, client management and risk management functions) that establishes the accountability of each of the parties for significant transactions We monitor accumulated exposure to single risks or to an underlying risk factor on a Group-wide basis We further manage our risk by external retrocession, risk swaps, or by transferring risk to capital markets through insurance-linked securities

Priorities are determined by the potential impact of risks Risks include any change that could have a short or long term negative impact on our business (eg the financial impact of insured losses) or alter our understanding of that risk  The risk assessment process described above is aimed at protecting Swiss Re's capital base by avoiding the acceptance of too much business that is exposed to the impacts of severe weather or other potential loss factors Another priority is potential reputation risk if business were accepted that included unacceptable practices relating to general environmental operating practices Swiss Re introduced its Sustainability Risk Framework process to minimize this kind of potential reputation risk

Swiss Re is committed to invest its assets in a responsible manner which is reflected by the integration of environmental, social and governance (""ESG"") criteria in our investment process To that end, roles and responsibilities of the different investment units with respect to responsible investing activities have been defined, in particular for the integration of ESG considerations in the investment process

The key document with regard to responsible investment and ESG considerations, including climate change is the Responsible Investment Policy This policy is a Group policy issued by the Group Chief Investment Officer that outlines the ESG business policy and approach to sustainability in the management of Swiss Re Group's investment assets This document describes the Responsible Investment Framework, Principles and corresponding roles and responsibilities of the different investment units and stakeholders involved in the management of Swiss Re Group's investment assets

Swiss Re's investment activities are also subject to the company's Sustainability Risk Framework (http://mediaswissrecom/documents/2016_corporate_responsibility_report_swissre_crr16pdf, see p 28) This framework consists of country and company exclusions, as well as eight policies on sensitive topics like oil and gas, mining, and an overarching environmental protection policy Each policy contains a number of predefined criteria and qualitative standards that may lead to the exclusion of a company or a country from our investment scope

The overall responsibility to monitor our commitment to responsible investment lies with the Group Chief Investment Officer, who is advised by the Asset Management Executive Team and the Asset Management Investment Committee Furthermore, an ESG Advisory Group formed by representatives of all investment units, legal, compliance and risk management, oversees and monitors the progress of Swiss Re's responsible investment activities, and ensures that our commitment is reflected in our day-to-day activities 

In 2007 we signed the UN Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI) and in 2012 the Principles for Sustainable Insurance (PSI), thereby formally endorsing our commitment to corporate responsibility The PRI and PSI are taken into account in Swiss Re's comprehensive responsible investment framework As a PRI signatory we provide in-depth reporting on our responsible investment activities The report is available on the PRI website at https://wwwunpriorg/signatory-directory/?co=&sta=&sti=&sts=&sa=join&si=join&ss=join&q=swiss+re

Loyal American Life Insurance Company," In addition to engaging with our internal stakeholders to prioritize risks and opportunities, we also monitor the activities related to climate change risk among our key stakeholders, which includes investors, corporate customers and industry peers 

Increasing energy efficiency at our facilities has been prioritized due to (1) cost savings and risk mitigation opportunities, (2) identified value to our stakeholders and (3) alignment with our mission and the increasingly globalized nature of our operations Based on our prioritization, we have a Strategic Sustainability Performance Plan in place that includes formal policies on energy and water consumption, and direct and indirect carbon dioxide emissions 

To increase energy efficiency and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, we have also prioritized the following areas of focus: (1) Real Estate (pursuing space optimization, energy-efficiency projects, green building materials, and LEED® and ENERGY STAR® certifications, and a ""green clean"" mandate); (2) Information technology (utilizing server virtualization, desktop virtualization and a zero e-waste policy); (3) Print procedures (reducing paper use through our electronic claims management systems, encouraging double-sided printing and high-recycled content office paper standards); and (4) Business travel (encouraging telecommuting, eRideShare board and pre-tax mass transit benefit program; and having a fuel-efficient, leased-vehicle fleet)

American Heritage Life Insurance Company," Our property business includes personal homeowners, commercial property, and other property insurance lines As of December 31, 2012, we are below our goal to have no more than a 1% likelihood of exceeding average annual aggregate catastrophe losses by $2 billion, net of reinsurance, from hurricanes and earthquakes, based on modeled assumptions and applications currently available The use of different assumptions and updates to industry models could materially change the projected loss Our growth strategies include areas previously restricted where we believe we can earn an appropriate return for the risk and as a result we may move closer to our goal in the future In addition, we have exposure to severe weather events which impact catastrophe losses

Property catastrophe exposure management includes purchasing reinsurance to provide coverage for known exposure to hurricanes, earthquakes, fires following earthquakes, wildfires and other catastrophes Allstate continues to work for changes in the regulatory environment, including recognizing the need for better catastrophe preparedness, improving appropriate risk based pricing and promoting the creation of government sponsored, privately funded solutions for mega-catastrophes that will make insurance more available and affordable

Allstate has a dedicated team of 15 employees who have accountability for monitoring and reporting on Allstate's exposure to catastrophes, as well as closely following ongoing scientific and hurricane modeling research through regular discussions with premiere catastrophe modelers The prevailing scientific thought about how climate change might be expected to impact the frequency and severity of future hurricanes is examined
While these actions can mitigate potential risks related to catastrophe exposure, the timing of catastrophes is largely unpredictable

Universal North America Ins. Co.," We do not believe that climate change would have a significant impact to our operations Nevertheless, as a property and casualty carrier we remain engaged in analysis pertaining to climate change and natural catastrophes as it relates to UNAICs risk exposure",1
American Retirement Life Insurance Company," Increases in energy and fuel costs may also result in broader inflationary pressures from our suppliers  For example, Cignas 2019 energy spend following our combination with Express Scripts is now approximately $25 million Additionally, Cignas Global Procurement and Third Party Management team now manages more than $50 billion in goods and services provided by over 13,000 suppliers globally Cigna's suppliers provide goods and services that support information technology, operations activities and internal corporate functions

Cigna also maintains a Supply Chain and Drug Procurement organization that is responsible for pharmacy network contracting, pharmaceutical and wholesaler purchasing, and manufacturer rebate contracting for our health services business Inflationary pressures associated with climate change could also potentially impact pricing within our health services business In 2019, nearly 70% of our revenues was associated with our health services business

From a long-term perspective, the link between climate change and human health may present broader socio-economic impacts that could potentially impact Cignas cost structure within the health services that we provide For example, potential correlations have been observed between climate change with increased prevalence of respiratory, bronchial and water-borne diseases Cignas efforts to increase the quality and affordability of health care, such as our focus on preventive care and digital health, have the potential to also support climate change mitigation and adaptation

Management Methods: We manage risks associated with energy and fuel costs through (1) our emissions reduction projects, (2) tracking and monitoring our progress toward energy reduction targets and (3) driving innovation in the transport of pharmaceuticals

Our Global Real Estate team considers this potential risk to inform decisions on making investments in emissions reduction projects In 2019, we completed a series of emissions reduction projects, which include lighting retrofits and enhancements to building automation systems  We also manage this risk through our emphasis on fleet efficiency Cigna's vehicle fleet exceeds the national average fuel efficiencythe majority of our vehicles are 4-cylinder with alternative fuel capabilities and hybrid engines, and are classified as partial zero emissions vehicles

To manage progress against our emissions reduction targets, we utilize a proprietary technology data management portal and utility tool to aggregate data for all the sustainability program efforts The utility tool provides a detailed dashboard of energy cost, consumption and variance across our real estate portfolio  in addition to ENERGY STAR® ratings  Currently, more than 50% of our United States locations are enrolled in the US Environmental Protection Agencys ENERGY STAR® program Additionally, all 12 Cigna office locations in the United Kingdom hold ISO 50001 Energy Management System Accreditations

In 2019, we also identified a new lower emissions solution for shipping temperature-sensitive medications The pilot of new plant-based, recyclable cooler is made with 90% less energy than traditional polystyrene coolers, provides effective temperature control and breaks down naturally at end-of-life

Additionally, Cigna continues to participate in and support local, national, and international discussions about climate change  specifically the connection between planetary health and human health  through engagement with our community partners, business partners, industry associations, and intergovernmental organizations

Extreme Weather Events: Increases in the frequency and severity of extreme weather events, such as hurricanes, typhoons, and wildfires, could impact our business services distribution capacities, and may cause damage to physical assets Additionally, Cignas large supplier network of over 13,000 suppliers globally provide critical goods and services to support operations (including our information technology systems) Extreme weather events have the potential to cause supply chain disruptions, which could potentially impact our ability to provide health services (including pharmacy benefits) to our customers and clients

Cigna is driven by an important mission to help improve the health, well-being, and peace of mind for those we serve To deliver on our mission, we must be prepared to provide our services and offer our products virtually without fail We also understand that climate change and environmental risks can pose unique challenges to clients and communities  specifically health and public health systems A recent example were the wildfires, which impacted Cignas customers in California Execution on Cigna's Customer Disaster Response Program also may result in making temporary policy changes, such as waiving various medical requirements, assisting with replacement medications, transferring prescriptions, and expanding its help line to proactively address customer service issues and provide personal assistance and support for all affected by a disaster

Additionally, Cignas Employee Assistance Program (EAP) may open its telephone lines to offer access to trained clinicians via the telephonic EAP services to members of the impacted communities We provide this access regardless of whether callers have Cigna EAP or not The EAP may also offer immediate access to on-site Critical Incident Services (CISD) support for Cigna clients

Through the Cigna Foundation, we also invest in supporting disaster relief efforts for affected communities when extreme weather events occur
The Cigna Foundation provides support to communities impacted by extreme weather events through charitable contributions and partnerships with credible, leading disaster relief organizations

Management Methods: We maintain an online Disaster Resource Center for first responders, health plan customers, and employer clients The site is continually updated by our Employee Assistance Consultant team, which has intimate knowledge of our provider network and can make real-time updates to help impacted stakeholders

Through our Customer Disaster Response Program, we offer access to trained clinician, on-site Critical Incident support, refilling prescriptions, and expanding our helpline to proactively address customer service issues and provide personal assistance and support for those affected

Cignas Business Continuity and Data Center Recovery plans sets forth procedures for data recovery, continuation of business functions, and the use of supporting technology to recover critical business processes The plans are updated and documented annually Cignas Data Center Recovery plans are tested routinely with end-user evaluations of the restored systems as part of the testing protocol Cignas enterprise-wide recovery strategies are also tested on an annual basis

Cignas critical applications run in hardened sites protected by an emergency generator Weve also repatriated core elements of our recovery capability including infrastructure to recover the top prioritized business functions and related computer applications through data and server replication

Our Corporate Security and Business Continuity teams work with all of our owned, leased, and managed assets that are deemed to be business critical and develop risk profiles  Based on the risk profile, a recovery time objective (RTO) is determined  this is how quickly the location has to be operating at what capacity Once the RTO is determined, appropriate business recovery solutions are designed for the location to meet that objective All managed properties are also provided an emergency preparedness guide to assist them in not only preparing for an emergency event but also for managing one as it occurs

Reputation: Corporate reputation on performance related to environmental responsibility, particularly on issues related to climate change, is increasingly important to Cignas corporate employer clients as evidenced by the frequent occurrence of sustainability questions on RFPs for potential corporate clients and RFIs from existing ones

Also, Cignas reputation on performance related to climate change and broader environmental, social, and governance (ESG) issues is becoming increasingly important to our employees, investors and other stakeholders For example, a recent Cone study found that 83% of Gen Z respondents surveyed consider a companys purpose when deciding where to work 87% of Gen Z respondents stated that they were inspired by climate activism of Greta Thunberg 

Among investors, Cigna has observed increased investor interest in climate change and broader ESG issues over the past 12 months, even following the COVID-19 outbreak Cigna has been included in the flagship Dow Jones Sustainability World Index for the past three consecutive years In 2019, we were named the industry leader for the second time in the Corporate Sustainability Assessment used to select Dow Jones Sustainability Index members

Management Methods: Guided by our Strategic Sustainability Performance Plan, Cigna has made continued investments since 2014 to support our energy strategy and long-term emissions reduction targets In 2019, we had our Scope 1 and 2 emissions assured for the fifth consecutive year 

Cigna closely monitors and responds to requests from corporate clients (including RFPs and RFIs) and requests related to climate change and corporate responsibility We also actively engage employees to enhance continuous improvement in the implementation of sustainability programs, which include our GreenSTEPS employee engagement program In addition to being internal advocates for Cignas environmental sustainability efforts, Cignas GreenSTEPS members also engage with their communities through local environmental projects For example, members of the GreenSTEPS and Service Operations teams volunteered their time to help build the first production-scale aquaponics system near our corporate headquarters in Hartford, Connecticut 

Cigna has been a member, since inception, of the UN Global Compacts Health is Everyones Business Action Platform The platform convenes a broad coalition of stakeholders to develop and advance a global agenda for planetary health in business The work of this coalition is focused on advancing human health by addressing health determinants related to climate and the environment In 2020, this workstream is becoming integrated within the UN Global Compacts Climate Action platform

Cigna has also recently completed a multi-dimensional materiality assessment to inform the advancement of our Cigna Connects corporate responsibility platform over the next decade Through interviews, surveys, and focus groups with stakeholders across the country, we connected with employees, employer clients, customers, healthcare providers, executive leadership, our board of directors, suppliers, thought leaders, and community partners

Paul Revere Life Insurance Company," To summarize, they are: 
 Risks driven by changes in regulation
 Risks driven by changes in physical climate parameters
 Risks driven by changes in other climate-related developments

In our US operations, we have identified the following risks driven by changes in regulation:

Lack of regulation resulting in potential increased operational costs: Future governmental emission programs either at the Federal, State or local level could impact our business Through trade organizations and other information sources, Unum keeps abreast of pending regulations that could impact our operations If a new regulation is implemented that impacts Unum, measures will be put into place to minimize the impact

1 Uncertainty surrounding new regulation resulting in potential increased capital costs: As global transition to a low-carbon economy escalates, Unum will be required to comply with CC regulations as they are presented Compliance with regulations requires man-power and capital expenditure that would not have been required in absence of the regulation Unum Group owns four physical sites in four states, SC, ME, TN, and MA We operate these facilities utilizing green building best practices We are positioned to adopt new regulations when and if enacted Unum has a government relations department that stays abreast of federal and state issues relating to all topics, including climate change, and has positioned Unum to respond as regulations are being formulated and adopted

In our US operations, we have identified the following risks driven by physical climate parameters:
1 Change in mean (average) temperature resulting in potential increased operational costs: This risk could cause an increased expense for utility consumption required for employee comfort in any of Unum's office buildings For example, in the Southeast, increases in temperatures caused by emissions will require additional cooling resulting in higher energy consumption to provide employee comfort while working Actions taken to address this potential risk include upgrade to our building systems to improve operational efficiency and lessen expenses

2 Other physical climate risk drivers which could potentially increase both capital and operational costs: the CHA campus is subject to tornado and severe storm damage; and Portland and Worcester are subjected to winter weather Shifts in weather patterns has resulted in major weather events such as tornados and flooding that can result in major physical damage to infrastructure in any of our buildings For example, in 2011, our Chattanooga, TN campus narrowly escaped damage caused by one of the 27 tornadoes that touched down in the area The campus suffered minor damage from the storms but was not directly impacted

3 Uncertainty of physical risks which could potentially increase both capital and operational costs: CC presents a plethora of weather-related risks as weather patterns become increasingly more severe and unpredictable These weather patterns present challenges as abnormal occurrences continue to materialize These uncertainties, including extremes in precipitation, droughts, increased snowfall and ice, rises in sea level, cyclones, etc are becoming more prevalent and require strategic planning, funding, and mitigation efforts

In our US operations, we have identified the following risks driven by other climate-related developments:
1 Reputation- which could potentially result in a reduced demand for our services: Unum provides services to a large number of fortune 500 companies and receives inquiries from customers about our environmental programs and performance and also from State Commissioners Negative publicity may result in current and potential customers from conducting business with Unum

American Casualty Company of Reading PA,"  We monitor state and federal proposals affecting natural catastrophes and respond in a way that best addresses CNAs underwriting principles  In addition, we disclose to our investors that climate change may be a factor in both the frequency and severity of catastrophe events, contributing to the potential for unpredictable and material losses",6
Riverport Insurance Company,"  This is done both by monitoring the aggregate exposures and by the use of computer modeling of such losses
	No such computer modeling is available for the business written within Berkley Life as this business is not subject to losses arising from natural catastrophes 
	All USA property business written in the Group is modeled within computer models developed specifically for this purpose  The Group licenses one vendor model, and outsources modeling in a second vendor model to provide a second perspective on catastrophe risk
	The results of the computer modeling are examined at Group level, at individual operating company level, and at individual policy level 
	The ERM team identifies to both senior management and to our operating companies those locations and policies which are most likely to give rise to a substantial loss from hurricane  Operating companies are expected to take appropriate action on any policy that gives rise to too great a catastrophe exposure; such actions may include the introduction of peril-specific deductibles and / or sublimits, the non-renewal of specific policies, the re-underwriting of particular segments of the portfolio, and the purchase of additional reinsurance protection
	The computer modeling results are discussed each quarter by the Group ERM committee
	The computer modeling results are used as part of the Groups assessment of its (ceded) reinsurance strategy  This reinsurance protects the Group if a damaging event should occur
	The ERM team investigates the possibility of model miss within vendor catastrophe models; this includes a comparison of modeled industry losses against revalued historic losses, investigation of individual sub-components within the model, and stress testing model frequency and severity assumptions
	Both senior management and our operating companies are regularly provided with updates on the latest published articles and reports on climate change as part of our emerging issues weekly update report

Pacific Indemnity Company,"

The Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) Committee monitors and qualifies all material risks to Chubb through an annual comprehensive review of global business disciplines Risks are also quantified for underwriting, credit and investments via capital modeling, and risk tolerance is established and monitored The Chief Risk Officer (CRO) reports to the Chief Financial Officer and provides updates, including on climate change, to the Board of Directors

Chubb has Emerging Risk Committees around the world that report their findings to the CRO These committees identify and monitor new and emerging hazards, from both property and liability perspectives, including change in weather patterns and the resulting associated risk We identify and monitor new and emerging risks by collecting data from many sources, including industry organizations and reinsurance partners; monitoring litigation and litigation trends; and engaging in internal analysis

Risk Assessment:
Risks are assessed and prioritized by their potential impacts, including risk of underwriting loss, investment risk and risk of changing customer need

Risk of Underwriting loss:
To assess the potential impact of climate change to significantly change our loss patterns we use catastrophe modeling, as well as projecting revised non catastrophe weather related loss trends In addition, we use a risk concentration management tool to monitor/control accumulations of exposure  Steps taken to manage exposure to weather-related risk include:
	reviewing the catastrophe model projections; 
	reviewing reinsurance terms and limits; 
	limiting underwriting exposure in peak zones;  
	reviewing and modifying our underwriting appetite and/or pricing and 
	encouraging our customers to take loss mitigation steps

Chubb Loss Control Services and Home Appraisal services play a crucial role in customer mitigation of many types of risk, including those related to weather

The Home Appraisal Service helps customers determine the potential reconstruction cost for their home and provides them with advice on loss mitigation Appraisers can offer security and fire prevention advice and identify safety measures in a home We also provide our Personal Lines customers with several informational tools to help them manage, prevent, and mitigate effects of weather-related events on their property On our website, for example, we have created a section Catastrophe Assistance with tips for before, during and after a flood, hurricane or windstorm, tornado, dust storm or wildfire We also have participated in public education programs to help homeowners mitigate their wildfire risk, including providing recommendations to use fire-resistive construction materials in wildfire-prone areas Prior to major hurricanes and wildfires, we attempt to reach out to our personal lines customers individually  

For commercial customers, our global network of experienced Loss Control risk engineers with deep industry and technical knowledge can share best practices to help mitigate or avoid a costly loss Our Loss Control Services approach is custom crafted to address each customers specific risks, including from weather-related events

Reinsurance:
We analyze our exposure to certain perils in various geographies, and we purchase catastrophe reinsurance to support that exposure and manage volatility in our results We purchase limits from reinsurers based on their financial position and ratings, and in order to diversify our coverage, we have issued catastrophe bonds which gives us access to capital on a multi-year basis

Catastrophe reinsurance coverage, including limits, geographies and perils, is reviewed and purchased annually and is based on our review of our probable maximum loss from extreme weather events such as hurricane, wildfire, earthquake, flood, winter storm and convective storms

Investment Risk:
We review investment risk and consider correlated insurance exposures when making bond investment selections to ensure that we are not overly exposed to environmental occurrences in any one geographic territory from both operational business (underwriting) and investment perspectives Additionally, we consider the impact of climate change when assessing the financial risk parameters of certain sectors, such as utilities, as well as investment classes such as corporate bonds and municipal bonds  

Risk of Changing Customer Need:
The operational risk review can identify opportunities to address emerging customer needs We have anticipated increased consumer demand for particular products as a result of climate change 

For example, as governments and industries seek to mitigate climate change and preserve natural capital, opportunities arise from the market for low-carbon energy and green technology We have over 25 years of experience in the Renewable Energy sector and have assembled a Clean Tech team to bring together expertise, products and services that support businesses innovating in such areas as smart grid technologies and resource optimization

In response to the increasing severity and length of drought conditions in the Western US and the subsequent increase in the risk of wildfires, we offer Wildfire Defense Services to our insureds in states most prone to these events The service will initiate efforts to help prevent or mitigate property losses, which may include the installation of a temporary perimeter sprinkler system or the application of a thin barrier of Thermo-gel® to the home or landscaping, if the threat of wildfire becomes imminent 

The combination of  ERM, standing Emerging Risk Committees, annual reviews and knowledgeable Loss Control and Home Appraisal staff facilitates ongoing review and updates of our data as well as an informed awareness of customer demand for climate related products and services",2

Jefferson Natl Life Ins Co of NY," Included within these risk mitigation efforts is the application of fortified standards developed by the Insurance Institute for Business and Home Safety (IBHS) As part of this program, mitigation credits can be earned by our customers thus reducing the premium we charge along with reducing the potential future losses due to weather-type events Nationwide also offers a home inventory process that allows consumers the ability to track their personal belongings for when an unfortunate event occurs In the past, Nationwide has mailed information to our members in high wildfire hazard areas in Western states The mailing provided them with a website and information from IBHS on how to make their homes and businesses safer from wildfire  Nationwide believes that proper hazard mitigation is an effective way to address the increasing threat from wildfire  Nationwide is in the midst of a multi-year process of re-inspecting our portfolio and making risk reduction recommendations to our members on how to mitigate their wildfire hazard
In addition, to continue driving more awareness around the benefits from risk mitigation, Nationwide has implemented a new endorsement focused on replacing roofs to more stringent building requirements at the time of an eligible loss which will result in a more weather-proofed roof IBHS guidance for mitigating property losses is available directly to the public at wwwdisastersafetyorg Increased risk sharing through the utilization of wind/hail deductibles is used to help encourage consumers to proactively mitigate weather claims In addition, Nationwide is active at the local and national level to help drive the necessary building code changes to make homes safer Nationwide is an active member of the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) Wildland and Rural Fire Protection committee This is a committee that develops codes, standards, and recommended practices for fire protection infrastructure used in land development in wildland, rural, and suburban areas
As catastrophe risk increases in certain markets, Nationwide continues to invest in the necessary tools to better understand the risk, whether it be hurricanes, severe thunderstorms or wildfires Financially, the importance of geographic diversification within Nationwides portfolio is one of the key levers to being a successful property insurer Included within this work is the integration of risk management findings into pricing, product development and distribution planning along with consumer education
Along similar lines, Nationwide constructed one of the first ever commercial buildings in San Antonio that is certified as fortified according to IBHS standards and we have also built a second office building to those standards in downtown Columbus The company continues to not only help drive these types of changes within the community but across the different businesses In partnership with home builders, banks, consumers, IBHS and legislatures, the necessary changes will need to occur leading to improvements in building codes and risk management in general
From a commercial standpoint, Nationwide provides education and loss control services to assist customers in identifying risks, ways to mitigate risks along with including exclusionary language for certain risk types within its contracts Through individual risk pricing modifications, those consumers who respond to these services in a positive manner could be eligible for improved pricing considerations

models; the near-term indications reflect more recent weather activity which may be 
the result of climate change 

These models are run annually against our in-force book to determine our potential loss 
exposure against various types of storm activity In addition, the Company uses various 
tools at the underwriting desk level to assess the total amount of property exposures 
that we write in specific geographic areas For example, the Company has established 
guidelines on how much exposure can be written depending on location

Farmers Insurance Company of Washington,"  We expect the overall losses from the perils of Wildfire, Flood and Hurricane, which are sensitive to climate change, to increase for society as a whole, and the insurance industry in particular  Wildfire risk is of particular concern to us given our concentration in the western United States    In addition, multiple causation risks, including natural and man-made causes, make it more challenging to fully understanding and quantify our exposure to risk

Farmers uses both internal and external catastrophe models to make our best assessment of prospective catastrophe risk for pricing, capital optimization and reinsurance purposes  We adjust the models based on our own experience, research and historical model performance  Our modeling work generates outputs on a deterministic and probabilistic basis which we use to manage our enterprise view of risk  While the modeling data and outputs continue to improve over time, there is still uncertainty around the outputs  Farmers views this uncertainty as a reason to be cautious and conservative in our selection and pricing of risk, and our overall tolerance of catastrophe exposure

An increasing number of regulatory functions encourage us to view risk arising from climate change  However, other regulatory functions disallow the use of this view in our pricing or risk selection and require that we underwrite our business without consideration of climate change  Many states do not permit the use of near term hurricane models that account for current sea temperatures and other factors which are viewed to be related to climate change  Other states do not permit the use of wildfire models, although these states will attest that we are in a period of higher than average fire risk  Some states will not permit changes to the models based on our experience, which limits our ability to utilize our experience and expertise in our business  We believe the insurance industry would be better able to address climate change and provide leadership on this issue if each state worked towards a consistent standard regarding climate change  As the populace is being encouraged to prepare and live as if climate change is real, the insurance industry must be permitted to do the same  

While climate change presents uncertainty, our continued work on model validation and correlation provides us with humble confidence that we can reasonably estimate our expected catastrophe losses including significant amounts of volatility now and into the future We temper this with the concern that retroactive changes made to the laws and regulations governing specific catastrophes can make all of our planning, capital management and modeling useless We urge restraint in making any retroactive legislative or regulatory change after the catastrophe  This should be done only under the most serious of circumstances and only as a last resort

What we cannot account for or incorporate in our pricing or our own internal view of risk, is the exposure presented by regulatory uncertainty  Regulatory uncertainty includes actions such as directives issued by state insurance departments and governors limiting the application of hurricane and/or named storm deductibles to Superstorm Sandy claims, the reopening of earthquake claims numerous years after the Northridge Earthquake, the attempt to retroactively assess insurers for Texas Windstorm Insurance Association losses five years after Hurricane Ike, and other post event changes made to commonly understood practices that were instrumental in our decision to insure these risks  These types of actions cannot be predicted, and thus cannot be incorporated into our models

Metropolitan Tower Life Insurance Company," Climate change may impact the frequency and/or severity of hurricanes, tropical cyclones, tornadoes and hail MetLifes climate change risks come from potential physical climate change and weather-related events that could have an impact on MetLifes internal operations or the nature of our financial services products  Both extreme climate change events and individual weather-related occurrences could disrupt our global offices or impact the financial needs of MetLifes customers  MetLife is a global company and has many of its offices and business functions serving in regions that are more vulnerable to extreme weather-related events, including Asia (MetLife has a strong presence in India and Japan), USA (especially the states on the east coast) and Africa MetLife also reviews and evaluates all relevant potential risks and exposures when negotiating and renewing our directors and officers liability and commercial general liability policies

Climate change is expected to have its largest impact on the homeowners line of business The Company reviews the monthly potential loss impact of hurricanes, tornadoes, and hail  For hurricanes, the Company utilizes three third party catastrophe models to analyze potential net losses across five hurricane zones in the United States The Companys exposure data is updated annually, but monitored monthly  The catastrophe models are typically revised each year, but many times the changes are minor  When a new version of a model with significant changes is released, the Company re-runs its exposure data as soon as practicably possible, vets the results for reasonability and incorporates the revised model results once the reasonability test is satisfied  The reasonability test includes a discussion with the modeling company or MetLifes broker about what changed and what are the expected impacts  The model results are used to develop an average annual hurricane provision for each zip code and shared with the Pricing Department to be incorporated into the rates  

The Company also manages its Probable Maximum Loss (PML) for each of the five hurricane regions  Each year the number of sales in the coastal areas of hurricane prone states to keep the PMLs stable is calculated  Actual sales in those areas are monitored in relation to the amount needed to keep the PMLs stable  States with significant deviations are reviewed on a case by case basis to determine the reason and best solution for the deviation

To mitigate the impact of large hurricane losses, the Company implemented mandatory hurricane wind deductibles, where allowed, in most states from Texas to Maine ranging from 1% to 5% depending on the state and the area within the state  The Company also excludes wind coverage in the more vulnerable hurricane areas of some states where allowed 

Another main source of physical climate change risk to MetLifes business operations comes from possible precipitation extremes and droughts, which could have an impact on MetLifes internal operations or the nature of our financial services products  Both extreme climate change events and individual weather-related occurrences have the potential to disrupt global offices or impact the financial needs of our customers, including increased claims from natural disasters and other catastrophes MetLife operates in nearly 50 countries across the globe, in three regions: the Americas; Europe, the Middle East and Africa; and Asia Each region and local office is vulnerable to precipitation extremes and droughts

These potential losses include destruction of our facilities and the disruption of services to our customers, as well as financial losses due to weather-related auto and homeowner insurance claims  Additional financial implications include potential increased operational cost and financial risks relating to loan defaults of agricultural losses

Beyond the direct potential physical effects of climate change, including increasing temperatures, precipitation extremes, droughts, natural disasters and other catastrophic weather events, MetLife also recognizes the indirect risks associated with climate change For example, MetLife recognizes that failing to reduce its own emissions could negatively impact its brand reputation, and thus strives to reduce its emissions levels Addressing climate change can also provide MetLife with a strategic advantage over its competitors  MetLife increasingly embraces emerging technologies and green products, factoring in climate change for business strategies, and risk management procedures to remain financially and operationally sound  The Company also acknowledges that increasing temperatures could impact employee health, could drive new legislation that could impact business, and could alter the overall global economy

The MetLife Foundation awards grants for disaster relief and rebuilding when a disaster occurs in a location where MetLife has significant presence  In 2014, the Foundation awarded $500,000 for disaster relief and longer-term rebuilding efforts

NORFOLK & DEDHAM MUTUAL FIRE INS CO,"  The following text, prepared by IBHS, is a brief description of the Institute and some of its activities that relate to the issue of climate change

IBHS is a 501©(3) organization, wholly supported by the property (re)insurance industry, which conducts objective, scientific research to identify and promote effective actions that strengthen homes, businesses, and communities against natural disasters and other causes of loss  IBHS does this by identifying and advocating improved property design, construction, retrofitting, maintenance, repair, and preparation practices  IBHS guidance for mitigating property losses is available directly to the public and to our members/policyholders, at wwwdiastersafetyorg, and through social media (eg, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Youtube and Vimeo)

IBHS advocates the concept of going green and building strong recognizing that addressing climate change involves both reducing greenhouse gas emissions and adapting homes, businesses, and communities to severe weather that may result from climate change:

As an insurance-supported organization, IBHS recognizes that climate change strategies must do more than build structures to be energy efficient  They must be built to modern fire protection standards to help resist fre and avoid the water/chemical deluge needed for fire suppression; they should be strong enough to avoid wind destruction and resulting relocation in landfills; and properties should be sited and elevated in a manner that protects against flooding and environmental degradation from landslides  All of these are part of going green

IBHS also firmly believes that adaptation is critical, not only to reduce long-term property insurance losses, but to buttress individual and societal resilience  All of the property protection measures that IBHS advocates to strengthen structures against current weather threats will also reduce future losses caused by climate change eve nts  And, the unprecedented scientific research conducted at the unique IBHS Research Center is critical to identification of new mitigation actions that may help protect against more severe weather events

Additionally, research conducted by IBHS will help to make sure that Green building enhancements do not inadvertently cause structures to be less disaster-resistant, or even worse, threaten the life safety of occupants or first responders  for example, photovoltaic arrays that take flight or pose fire suppression challenges are the antithesis of building strong
As a building science institute, and due to antitrust concerns, IBHS does not have access to, and cannot compile, a list of market-based discounts offered by specific insurers with respect to current or future weather scenarios  That said, IBHS research helps its member companies to better understand structural vulnerability and the role that mitigation plays in reducing damage from severe weather, as well as what mitigation features to look for when inspecting a residential or commercial building

A few states (Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, and South Carolina) have developed legislative or regulatory discount frameworks for homes built or retrofitted to the code-plus, hazard-specific FORTIFIED new construction and retrofit standards developed by IBHS  In these states, the institute has worked with insurance regulators and insurance companies to make sure that the discount programs work as they were intended upon enactment, and actually facilitate risk-based pricing, which can serve both to encourage effective mitigation and discourage unsound development in disaster-prone areas

The quickest way for individual property owners to find out if their residential or commercial building qualifies for an incentive (for example, by meeting the designation requirements of the FORTIFIED program) is to ask their insurance department or company  In addition to discounts, insurance incentives related to mitigation may include a positive decision by an underwriter to provide coverage in the voluntary, rather than through the residual, market, lower deductibles, or more favorable coverage terms relating to post-disaster claims payments  Again, these are business decisions made by individual insurers, and IBHS neither influences such decisions nor specifically tracks them

Asuris Health Northwest," However, Cambia does have a formal sustainability program that seeks to incorporate the triple bottom line framework (economic growth, environmental stewardship, and social equity) into its planning, decision-making, and operations The sustainability program includes efforts to incorporate greater environmental stewardship into company operations Working with Cambias Real Estate and Facilities department, Information Technology (IT), and Human Resources, Cambia has undertaken the following efforts that will result in reduced greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions:

	Information Technology (IT): There are several efforts within Cambias IT infrastructure where technology and date center infrastructure changes have resulted in efficiencies directed at power, cooling, and space:
o	Major cooling upgrade to Salt Lake City data center
o	Switch to more efficient servers
o	Server virtualization
o	Mainframe consolidation
o	Increased data storage efficiencies
o	Replace firewall infrastructure with a more energy-efficient system
o	Replaced load balancer infrastructure with a more energy-efficient system
o	Upgraded our call center telephone system
o	Recycle eWaste though a BAN-certified eCyclerShift to print on demand and double-sided paper
	Real Estate and Facilities:
o	Replaced aging HVAC system (boilers and chillers) with more energy efficient system
o	Established standardized HVAC temperature set points, to maximize unit efficiencies, which reduced energy consumption
o	Implemented daylight harvesting in Burlington, and implementing in locations when remodels occur
o	Changed lighting in Salem garage from sodium vapor to fluorescent
o	Received Energy Star certification in 2 locations (Burlington and Tacoma), tracking energy use in all locations through Energy Star
o	Contracting with a janitorial vendor that uses proprietary green cleaners and microfiber towels
o	Renovating and maintaining our office space through use of low VOC paints and carpets, purchasing products with recycled content, reusing materials and furniture where possible, recycling materials such as carpet
o	Conducting waste audits to assess the waste stream and identify opportunities to reduce waste and increase recycling 
	Human Resources
o	Reducing our actual footprint through telework and mobile work arrangements An estimated 27% of Cambia employees now work remotely This initiative has reduced/eliminated commutes for these employees with a commensurate reduction in emissions (We have not measured the reduced emissions or other environmental benefits of this shift to remote and mobile work) While we expect this effort to have decreased emissions, we recognized that there is some displacement of emissions to employees who are now lighting, heating, and cooling their homes during the day when they are working from home
o	Cambia has a strong commute reimbursement program that subsidizes public transit passes and carpooling
o	Cambia also has a strong bike commuter program that encourages employees to bike to work The bike commuter program also provides support to beginning bike commuters through a bike buddy program and various bike-commuting workshops Cambia participates in May Bike to Work Month and the Bike Commute Challenge in September We estimate that 80 employees bike commute during the summer and 40 commute regularly by bike in the winter

Swiss Re Life & Health America Inc.,"swissrecom/rethinking/sustainable_energy/our_position_and_objectiveshtml) The governance process of the company's climate change activities includes various Group Executive Committee members and an annual presentation on Swiss Re's climate change strategy and activities is made to the Board of Director's Chairman's and Governance Committee  On a day-to-day basis the topic is managed by the Head Sustainability Risk  The Head Sustainability Risk and his team are responsible for implementing Swiss Re's climate change strategy and for coordinating the associated activities, and are the central point of communication for all climate-related inquiries from within and outside the company

Climate-related risks are systematically assessed during risk and underwriting process Priority is given to factors that could have the largest or most immediate financial impact, supplemented by research into climate change and its impacts Various units contribute to the assessment, including Group Sustainability Risk, which coordinates Swiss Re's climate change response Emerging Risk Management identifies and assesses new or emerging risks, including those climate related Catastrophe Perils unit designs and maintains loss models and supports the assessment of climate related risks as part of the underwriting process 

Swiss Re's property and casualty business is written using the four-eye principle: transactions must be approved by at least two authorized individuals  with the exception of single risk acceptances, which can be authorized by one underwriter, with the four-eye principle taken care of by spot checks after acceptance Each underwriter is assigned an individual underwriting authority based on technical skills and experience; any business exceeding this authority triggers a well-defined escalation process

Large individual transactions that could materially affect the Group's and Business Units risk exposure require independent review and sign-off by Risk Management before they can be authorized This is part of our three signature approval process (involving Swiss Re's underwriting, client management and risk management functions) that establishes the accountability of each of the parties for significant transactions We monitor accumulated exposure to single risks or to an underlying risk factor on a Group-wide basis We further manage our risk by external retrocession, risk swaps, or by transferring risk to capital markets through insurance-linked securities

Priorities are determined by the potential impact of risks Risks include any change that could have a short or long term negative impact on our business (eg the financial impact of insured losses) or alter our understanding of that risk  The risk assessment process described above is aimed at protecting Swiss Re's capital base by avoiding the acceptance of too much business that is exposed to the impacts of severe weather or other potential loss factors Another priority is potential reputation risk if business were accepted that included unacceptable practices relating to general environmental operating practices Swiss Re introduced its Sustainability Risk Framework process to minimize this kind of potential reputation risk

Swiss Re is committed to invest its assets in a responsible manner which is reflected by the integration of environmental, social and governance (""ESG"") criteria in our investment process To that end, roles and responsibilities of the different investment units with respect to responsible investing activities have been defined, in particular for the integration of ESG considerations in the investment process

The key document with regard to responsible investment and ESG considerations, including climate change is the Responsible Investment Policy This policy is a Group policy issued by the Group Chief Investment Officer that outlines the ESG business policy and approach to sustainability in the management of Swiss Re Group's investment assets This document describes the Responsible Investment Framework, Principles and corresponding roles and responsibilities of the different investment units and stakeholders involved in the management of Swiss Re Group's investment assets

Swiss Re's investment activities are also subject to the company's Sustainability Risk Framework (http://reportsswissrecom/corporate-responsibility-report/2017/) This framework consists of country and company exclusions, as well as eight policies on sensitive topics like oil and gas, mining, and two overarching policies, whereof one is about environmental protection Each policy contains a number of predefined criteria and qualitative standards that may lead to the exclusion of a company or a country from our investment scope

The overall responsibility for our ESG approach lies with the Group Chief Investment Officer who signs off investment decisions within the Groups Strategic Asset Allocation, and who is advised by the Asset Management Executive Team and the Asset Management Investment Committee Swiss Res Head Responsible Investing (Head RI) develops and coordinates the implementation of the ESG strategy within the unit As part of this role, the Head RI steers the ESG Advisory Board, a committee formed by representatives of all investment units, as well as Legal, Compliance and Group Risk Management to report on responsible investment activities in the various investment units, develop and review improvement ideas, share knowledge and monitors implementation progress 

In 2007 we signed the UN Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI) and in 2012 the Principles for Sustainable Insurance (PSI), thereby formally endorsing our commitment to corporate responsibility The PRI and PSI are taken into account in Swiss Re's comprehensive responsible investment framework As a PRI signatory we provide in-depth reporting on our responsible investment activities The report is available on the PRI website at https://wwwunpriorg/signatories/swiss-re-ltd/1829article

Nationwide Insurance Company of Florida," NWIs primary responsibility is to adhere to the investment and compliance policies established by its clients In accordance with the investment policies of the clients, NWI has a duty to assess the risks and opportunities of potential and current investments, which include those arising from climate change Therefore, NWIs credit research team considers both climate change and environmental regulations and disclosures along with many other factors in its assessment of the business risks and opportunities of all current and potential investments NWI also considers the effects of legislative action at the portfolio level when allocating funds across asset classes The potential long-term effects of climate change are considered in a number of ways across the asset classes where NWI actively invests on behalf of its clients

Some examples:
 For real estate/commercial mortgage loan investments, the potential impact of climate change factors into the evaluation/underwriting process by considering proximity to coastal areas and increased risk of tropical storm damage
 For municipal bond investments, the ability of the bond issuer (ie municipality) to repay debt is largely influenced by the health of its local economy and stability of its population (tax) base Climate-change issues ranging from water scarcity in the Southwest to coastal migration in Florida are considered when evaluating potential investments
 For corporate bond and equity investments, we review a companys policy and practice to manage climate change and environmental risks in order to assess their potential impact on overall credit worthiness We also actively monitor industry sectors that are more sensitive to climate change and environmental risks

When assessing and managing all of these risks, we consider overall company financial exposure, including insured coverage, not just investment risk

We have the following practices in place to ensure that our business mitigates, adapts, and advocates for CC and that it maintains integrated into our business strategy:
 Mitigation: ie insurance coverage for people affected by weather-related disabilities, disease, health and personal tragedies 
 Adaptation: dedicated in-house research teams in place to asses and recommend products and services in response to environmental and market needs and changes The impact on health from emerging environmental changes and overall climate change are continually assessed as part of our business strategy Adaptation, enables us to identify business opportunities/priorities to ensure that we are financially sound and offering products and services that are needed and relevant to emerging needs 
 Advocacy: we are active in various committees, working groups, communities, and trade associations to educate and influence CC reductions

Our CC mitigation, including emission reduction targets, is reflected in our Strategic Energy Management Program (USEMP) Our enterprise-wide target by 2020 is to have reduced our energy by 30%, waste and water by 50% and CO2e emissions by 30% (base year 2008) This is being achieved through more efficient energy and water use, less business travel, use of green power, and investment in renewable energy Various smaller-scale projects to mitigate emissions are already in place, eg duplex printing to reduce paper, carpool programs, single-stream recycling, and many more 

The described approach is reflected in our short-term strategy, with recent findings being integrated into our business model and minor adjustments being made to our pricing and development of new products

Regarding our long-term CC strategy: Our Real Estate Management, Risk, and Product Development departments play an important role in trend analysis, long-term product development, and integration into our business strategy (ie internal adoption of renewable energy- in 2013 we began purchasing 5% of our total energy in RECs and plan to incrementally increase that each year)

ACE Property and Casualty,"

Chubb has been a leading proponent and user of catastrophe models to quantify natural catastrophe risk for product pricing, risk management, capital allocation purposes and to simulate and estimate hurricane losses Chubb uses models to aggregate and monitor natural catastrophe exposures across its portfolio and to ensure that its capital base is sufficiently strong to meet the expectations of regulators, rating agencies and policy holders and to provide shareholders with an appropriate risk-adjusted return This information is valuable in identifying possible market opportunities

In 2015, for example, a priority initiative in 2015 involved developing an enhanced flood risk management tool to give underwriters and risk managers improved modeling, underwriting and portfolio management capabilities

Chubbs risk management modeling and underwriting practices are adapted to the developing risk exposures attributed to climate change Since the earths climate appears to be changing in ways inconsistent with the historical record upon which catastrophe models draw data, Chubb has adopted a shorter-term view of event frequency that is higher than the long-term historical frequency Standard & Poors has rated Chubbs ERM process Strong, placing it among the top 20% of North America and Bermuda insurance companies in S&Ps May 2015 ERM rating report  

Chubbs process accounts for the potential impact of catastrophe and climate risks on the companys own facilities and operations Although minimal, direct risk to Chubbs business operations exists if such weather events occur in places where Chubb has offices Chubb has developed a Business Continuity Program, which has been tested during severe weather events, and Chubbs operations have functioned effectively

Chubb identifies all known and emerging risks that could have a significant impact on overall capital levels and financial results Our analysis of the impact of risks ranges from the known (based on definitive historical loss experience) to the hypothetical (based on a probable maximum (PML) calculation) Regarding the potential effects of catastrophe losses, we continue to closely monitor our catastrophe risk accumulation around the world

Energy efficiency has always been an important area of focus for The Hanover More than 20 years ago, The Hanover began a journey to improve its carbon footprint From an original investment in ultra-efficient ice harvesting thermal storage technology for cooling its buildings, to upgrading building fan systems with high efficiency variable speed drive motors, installing continuous commissioning energy management systems, replacing much of its florescent lighting with efficient LED lighting, and the installation of white roofs on buildings to lower heating and cooling requirements, The Hanover has worked tirelessly to reduce its energy consumption During 2017, The Hanover has undertaken a multi- million dollar project to replace over 300 single pane windows with high efficiency, energy saving low-e double pane windows at its Headquarters (HQ) facility in Worcester, Massachusetts The culmination of these and many other energy conservation projects have resulted in the achievement of the prestigious EPA Energy Star certification for the past eight consecutive years for The Hanovers owned properties This certification affirms top quartile performance in energy usage according to EPA guidelines In addition, for the past seven consecutive years, 100% of the electricity consumed on The Hanovers 800K square foot HQ campus and a total of over 80% of the entire electricity demand across The Hanovers 14M square foot office portfolio is offset by certified Renewable Energy Certificates   

The Hanover has also established a leadership position in the area of environmental responsibility For over a decade, The Hanover has worked diligently to improve and strengthen its Green Cleaning program This program improves indoor air quality, reduces water consumption and energy usage, and utilizes cleaning products that have minimal impact to the waste stream The Hanover also takes pride in its innovative and robust recycling and compost programs which year after year effectively divert approximately 40% of the total waste stream at its HQ facility away from landfills  

The Hanover recognizes the impact its employees have on the environment as they commute to and from work With this in mind, The Hanover has long supported the use of alternate forms of travel to reduce Greenhouse Gas emissions At its HQ facility, The Hanover partnered with Mass-Rides, a ride-matching service sponsored by the Massachusetts Department of Transportation, which rewards employees for walking, biking, telecommuting, carpooling, vanpooling, taking transit, or working a compressed week With the recognition that electric cars materially contribute to the reduction of carbon emissions and a healthier planet, we have invested in electric car charging stations for employees and visitors at our HQ facility With Massachusetts anticipating that 300,000 electric vehicles will be on the road by 2025, we are proud to help pave the way for widespread use of alternative fuel vehicles  The Hanover also supports employee flexible work schedules which allow many employees to work from home, further improving air quality and reducing traffic on our roadways For these efforts, The Hanover continuously earns the ECO Leadership award from Massachusetts Department of Transportation 

Beyond the measurable results above, each year The Hanover encourages active hands on employee participation by hosting an Employee Earth Day Celebration, to educate and showcase energy efficiency and environmental conservation This much-anticipated event includes interactive exhibits, booths and presentations by internal groups, vendors and other exhibitors that invest their time and energy to make ours a more energy efficient, green-friendly planet Employees are encouraged to attend the event, visit with the exhibitors, learn and become an active participant in reducing their carbon footprint not only at work, but in their homes and communities as well   

All of these efforts have a significant impact on our organization Most important, our sustainability efforts and programs make a meaningful impact in reducing The Hanovers carbon footprint We have also witnessed a significant reduction in energy consumption and experienced a material cost savings as a result of our efforts Finally, as we continue to strive to recruit the best talent in the industry, our sustainability practices have helped us attract more environmentally-conscious employees, especially early-in-career talent, who view sustainability as a baseline requirement for their employer, and who challenge The Hanover to do even more

New Hampshire Insurance Company," The majority of policies exposed to catastrophic events are one-year contracts allowing us to quickly adjust our exposure to catastrophic events if climate changes or other events increase the frequency or severity of catastrophes

AIG PC uses industry recognized models and other tools to evaluate catastrophic events and assess the probability and magnitude of such events AIG PC periodically monitors the exposure risks of our worldwide operations and adjusts the models accordingly

Climate change may increase both the frequency and severity of claims or the cost of defending such claims AIG PC policies are primarily written for periods of 12 months, providing AIG PC with the ability to modify underwriting practices and pricing procedures; limiting the financial impact of such increase in claims Each line of business and many individual policyholders may have different exposures to the effects of climate change

The strength of AIGs diverse and global franchise helps manage risks efficiently by limiting the economic impact of any single event and by contributing to a relatively stable risk profile overall
However, AIG monitors natural catastrophe exposures on an ongoing basis and, through the AIG PC Environmental Working Group, is examining the latest climate science to better understand how climate change may potentially impact the frequency and severity of future extreme weather events",7

First Specialty Insurance Corporation," The greatest insured loss potentials come from tropical cyclones, tornado, hail, winter storms, and floods Other risks include snow storms, ice storms, wild fire, and drought The physical impacts of climate change mainly pose a risk to our property insurance and reinsurance business Although the risks are global, the greatest potential impacts come from areas that are both highly exposed and have a high insurance penetration rate These include the Gulf and East coasts of the United States for the US entities (and non-US entities that write US business) in the Group

Through international affiliates, Swiss Re is also exposed to coastal and inland areas of European states (including, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, the Netherlands and the UK) and Japan There is already a high level of climate risk in many regions This will increase unless appropriate greenhouse gas emissions reductions are achieved and climate resilience measures implemented The potential impacts of climate change on human health are likely to be less visible in the short-term In the US, Westport Insurance Corporation writes employer stop loss and HMO (Health Maintenance Organization) reinsurance Potential insured losses are most likely in industrialized countries due to the high levels of insurance penetration The greatest exposure to climate-related impacts on life and health tend to be in developing countries that have far smaller insurance markets Currently, we do not consider the risk of potential climate related losses to our life and health operations to be as high as the risk facing our property business

It is difficult to predict the future and determine how much of an influence climate change may have on any atmospheric caused risk We can make certain estimates as to where the risk may increase (eg coastal communities from sea level rise) due to climate change over the next century but, for example, we do not know how well as a society we will adapt to these changes in risk going forward through better zoning, building practices etc Exclusive of climate change, the costs associated with atmospheric related events are increasing due to changes in wealth, construction costs, and our desire to live in coastal and other exposed areas Our business relies on understanding and anticipating to the extent possible all risks; current, future, actual, and possible Losses relating to natural catastrophes are growing and changes in climate will lead to more physical losses in other sectors including agriculture and tourism as well as coastal areas, woodlands and in locations prone to flash flooding We can use our tools and technology to estimate this impact based on current scientific projections

As mentioned in question 2, risks (including climate risks) that could threaten our ability to function as a company across our various operating locations are assessed by our Safety and Security unit Swiss Re operates a comprehensive group-wide Operational Risk and Business Continuity Management system Each location has a local Safety and Security Officer in place All reasonable measures are taken to ensure operational effectiveness even in critical and emergency situations We do not consider climate risk to be a major threat to the operational effectiveness of Swiss Re locations Regardless, the potential for climate change to increase losses led to the development of Swiss Re's climate change strategy and provided the impetus for increased investment in climate risk research, awareness building, advocacy and reducing the company's own carbon footprint

Legislative or regulatory actions taken by Federal and State governments in response to climate change may pose new risks but also opportunities for a company like Swiss Re For example, regulation in the US or at the international level leading to an agreement on a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions will spur the development of renewable energy projects, and may lead to increased demand for insurance products offered by our company

Illinois Farmers Insurance Company,"  As a long-term investor focused on managing assets to liabilities, we believe that investors taking both financial and non-financial considerations into account when making investment decisions will be the most successful in the long term  Issues such as corporate governance, climate change, use of natural resources, health and safety, labor relations, and human rights can be important drivers of investment risk and reward

We believe that a pro-active integration of relevant Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) factors into the investment process alongside traditional financial metrics and state-of-the-art risk management practices could support our investment result  However, integration of such factors requires diligence, expertise and focus  We do not believe that simply dedicating specific investment portfolios to the latest climate branded product of the asset management industry creates sustainable value for our stakeholders and the environment

Our investments are primarily managed by third-party asset managers, and it is at this level that individual security selection decisions are made  These asset managers operate within agreed portfolio guidelines set by Farmers and take all aspects into account, both financial and non-financial, when managing Farmers individual portfolios to ensure maximum value creation 

As our core competency is selecting the right asset managers and evaluating them based on their superior investment processes, we have taken the following actions:
     1)	For the procurement of new asset managers, we include questions related to the inclusion of ESG factors in the investment process into our request for proposal (RFP)
     2)	We have implemented the capability to monitor ESG ratings provided by MSCI in our risk systems  This allows us to enter into a proactive dialogue with our asset managers about risk exposures to environmental factors",4

For example, we always encourage our auto policyholders to use telematics, not only because it makes drivers safer, but also because it encourages drivers to be more fuel efficient (wasteful speeding and rapid starts/stops are recorded) In fact, the company offers a bundle of fleet services including telematics, incenting them to use the devices to improve fleet operation efficiencies We also advise our fleet clients of risk management best practices, such as selecting drivers based upon their driving histories, including but not limited to speeding and reckless driving (which wastes fuel and results in greater emissions)
Our insureds understand that more miles driven and unnecessary personal use of company vehicles by employees increases their exposure to risk and usually their premium as well Insureds may be advised that reducing unnecessary miles driven and personal use of company vehicles by employees can reduce their premiums and also have a positive impact on climate change by reducing fuel usage and emissions
During our property surveys we always look at the age and condition of HVAC systems, electrical services, etc When these systems exceed 20 years of age, they are more likely to produce property claims from fires, etc When we identify these conditions it is our standard practice to recommend that the client replace or upgrade their systems with units meeting current codes and standards Although we dont specifically ask insureds to replace old inefficient systems for efficiency purposes, our practices does have the effect of encouraging insureds to replace older systems with newer ones (which are also more efficient in virtually all cases) The use of LED lighting in warehouses is another example where ProSight and other insurers encourage clients to replace older, (inefficient & dangerous) metal halide lighting with newer systems that save tremendous amounts of energy (and are safer)  Additionally, loss control surveys also include assessment of risk exposures including vulnerability to flooding, power outages, brush fires, etc If we find situations which warrant improvement, we make recommendations to client to help them reduce chances of loss This has the side benefit of helping them deal more effectively with the impacts of climate change on their local environment
The Company recognizes the positive impact of solar energy on climate change, and in fact we are one of the fastest growing insurers of solar installers, through our solar installers insurance program

Sun Life and Health Insurance Company U.S.," 

As noted in our response to question two:

In 2017, Sun Life Investment Management(1) began developing a formal climate change investment strategy as a part of codifying the asset management businesss stand-alone sustainability principles for addressing non-financial risks/issues in both our business practices and investment management operations

As a part of our current investment process, we incorporate ESG factors for assessing investment risks We evaluate each investment on many factors, including risk, return, capital treatment, diversification, and how it fits with our role as a steward of policyholder and shareholder funds

In 2017, we convened a task force composed of our public and private fixed income investment teams to: (i) assess our existing portfolio investments in coal, oil sands producers and related industries such as railways and pipelines (collectively referred to as Targeted Industries) from both an economic
and headline risk perspective; and (ii) recommend parameters for future investments in such Targeted Industries both as the company exists today and over the term of the investment in consideration

As national and sub-national GHG reduction commitments and cap and trade schemes are increasingly introduced, further investment opportunities may emerge for Sun Life Sun Lifes more than 30 years of experience in clean and renewable energy investment in its Project Finance Investments area could present additional investment opportunities for the Company We believe there will be a growing demand for efficient public transit infrastructure, and there will be an opportunity to provide lending on such developments Similarly, GHG emissions regulation could present an opportunity through increased demand for Sun Lifes real estate developments that meet Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) or other environmental standards LEED Green Building Rating System encourages and accelerates global adoption of sustainable building and development practices LEED is the nationally accepted benchmark for the design, construction and operation of high-performing green buildings We aspire to make LEED compliance part of our investment criteria and we have a number of real estate investments which have received, or are in the process of obtaining, LEED certifications 
We also participate in other industry programs which monitor the environmental profile of our buildings For example, Sun Life participates in Building Environmental Standards (BESt) program, which is the Canadian environmental program managed by Building Owners and Managers Association (BOMA) The program recognizes excellence in environmental management and performance and under the program all buildings undergo a third party verification review before achieving any of the four levels of BOMA BESt certification A number of our real estate investments have received BOMA BESt certification

A 2015 study commissioned by our subsidiary Bentall Kennedy Group provided empirical evidence that sustainable buildings provide better returns to owners through higher occupancy levels, higher rental rates and lower rent concessions (Please see Devine, A, & Kok, N (2015) Green Certification and Building Performance: Implications for Tangibles and Intangibles The Journal of Portfolio Management, Special Real Estate Issue)

To ensure the BOD and executive management receive information about emerging risks, the enterprise has several processes in place to ensure that emerging and evolving risks with the potential to impact the Enterprise continue to be identified ERM has historically facilitated a formal risk interview process annually As part of this process, all areas of the organization participate in risk interviews, including operating company leadership, division leadership, senior leadership and Risk Committee members Risks identified can include those due to changes in processes, new strategies, or external factors such as the changes to the industry and the way we conduct business  One ongoing risk is the impact of severe weather events  While this risk is one that is continuously monitored in the organization, the ERM process considers changes to experience, computer models, and trends identified by experts through ERMs networking and involvement in professional organizations  Exposures are evaluated in relation to capital quarterly to ensure the risk is within tolerance, and therefore, within the stated enterprise risk policy appetite and tolerance

American Familys investment managers take the issue of climate risk into consideration in the same manner as any other potential drivers of risk and return in the investment portfolio  Investments are managed to ensure the organization can respond in the event of a natural catastrophe

Medica Insurance Company," In the past few years, Medica has implemented green initiatives such as: 
	The buildings were reroofed in 2012 due to improper installation  During the reroofing, additional insulation was added to make the buildings more energy efficient
	Medica added CO2 monitors to the building automation system so we can control the % of outside air used based on these levels  This allows us to utilize more inside air reducing the cost of heating and cooling outside air
	Medica changed out all the fluorescent lamp fixtures with new T8 bulbs and electronic ballasts decreasing the amount of energy required to light the buildings
	Medica changed out all the high intensity lighting in the ramps and 401 garage to more energy efficient lighting
	Medica installed occupancy sensors in our offices and emergency stairwells to turn off unnecessary lighting
	Medica have installed automatic flushers, restroom faucets and towel dispensers to decrease water use and waste
	Medica have an on-site recycling program at all desks to reduce waste
	Medica are currently having the 401 building envelope and windows re-caulked to prevent air and water infiltration, preserving the integrity of the building and positively affecting energy usage
	Additional changes were made to both the 301 and 401 buildings that have earned us LEAD certification
	Medica have been awarded Energy Star rating each year for the past 6 years
	These changes have resulted in double digit reductions in our electricity usage
	Implementation of Uniflow: a Secure Print Management system / server, that typically reduces print waste by 21%
	Implementation of an Opt Out opportunity for Members and Employer Groups who would rather receive communication electronically or via postings on our Web Site

Meemic,"  While ACIA does not provide any premium discounts for green or energy efficient vehicles or homes, the Florida packaged policy has an additional wind mitigation discount available which is tied to the insured propertys conformance with applicable building codes  ACIA does offer discounts for Fortified Homes if the dwelling is certified as Fortified for Safer Living by the Institute for Business and Home Safety

ACIA is also a member of the Insurance Institute for Business and Home Safety (IBHS), an organization focused on reducing weather related losses through research, education and preventative measures
The following text, prepared by IBHS, is a brief description of the Institute and some of its activities that relate to the issue of climate change 

IBHS is a 501(c)(3) organization, wholly supported by the property (re)insurance industry, which conducts objective, scientific research to identify and promote effective actions that strengthen homes, businesses, and communities against natural disasters and other causes of loss  IBHS does this by identifying and advocating improved property design, construction, retrofitting, maintenance, repair, and preparation practices IBHS guidance for mitigating property losses is available directly to the public and to our members/policyholders, at wwwdisastersafetyorg, and through social media (eg, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, YouTube and Vimeo)  

IBHS advocates the concept of going green and building strong recognizing that addressing climate change involves both reducing greenhouse gas emissions and adapting homes, businesses, and communities to severe weather that may result from climate change: 

	As an insurance-supported organization, IBHS recognizes that climate change strategies must do more than build structures to be energy efficient They must be built to modern fire protection standards to help resist fire and avoid the water/chemical deluge needed for fire suppression; they should be strong enough to avoid wind destruction and resulting relocation in landfills; and properties should be sited and elevated in a manner that protects against flooding and environmental degradation from landslides All of these are part of going green 

	IBHS also firmly believes that adaptation is critical, not only to reduce long-term property insurance losses, but to buttress individual and societal resilience All of the property protection measures that IBHS advocates to strengthen structures against current weather threats will also reduce future losses caused by climate change events And, the unprecedented scientific research conducted at the unique IBHS Research Center is critical to identification of new mitigation actions that may help protect against more severe weather events 

	Additionally, research conducted by IBHS will help to make sure that green building enhancements do not inadvertently cause structures to be less disaster-resistant, or even worse, threaten the life safety of occupants or first respondersfor example, photovoltaic arrays that take flight or pose fire suppression challenges are the antithesis of building strong 

As a building science institute, and due to antitrust concerns, IBHS does not have access to, and cannot compile, a list of market-based discounts offered by specific insurers with respect to current or future weather scenarios That said, IBHS research helps its member companies to better understand structural vulnerability and the role that mitigation plays in reducing damage from severe weather, as well as what mitigation features to look for when inspecting a residential or commercial building 

A few states (Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, and South Carolina) have developed legislative or regulatory discount frameworks for homes built or retrofitted to the code-plus, hazard-specific FORTIFIED new construction and retrofit standards developed by IBHS 
In these states, the Institute has worked with insurance regulators and insurance companies to make sure that the discount programs work as they were intended upon enactment, and actually facilitate risk-based pricing, which can serve both to encourage effective mitigation and discourage unsound development in disaster-prone areas 

The quickest way for individual property owners to find out if their residential or commercial building qualifies for an incentive (for example, by meeting the designation requirements of the FORTIFIED program) is to ask their insurance department or company  In addition to discounts, insurance incentives related to mitigation may include a positive decision by an underwriter to provide coverage in the voluntary, rather than through the residual, market, lower deductibles, or more favorable coverage terms relating to post-disaster claims payments Again, these are business decisions made by individual insurers, and IBHS neither influences such decisions nor specifically tracks them

We implemented the latest developments in fresh-water flood modeling that provide a better understanding of this vulnerability than existing data such as FEMA Flood Zones and are working to incorporate this into our pricing and capital planning  This is also combined with our hurricane models, as fresh-water flooding is often the leading cause of vehicle hurricane losses (along with wind and storm surge)  We also use government and academic forecasts as inputs to our hurricane loss models along with vendor-supplied loss models for Homeowners lines  For other risks, we incorporate historical data and insights from experts  The models separate the cause (the storm or weather event) from the loss function so that changes in the storm characteristics (frequency, intensity, size, duration and correlation with other weather risks) are correctly reflected in our aggregate loss estimates  We generate separate and independent results/exposures for auto vs property type risks

We have stress tested our economic capital estimates for hurricane risk exceeding our historical values by increasing our expected frequency and severity in the Gulf Coast and landfall location in the North Atlantic  With hurricane being our greatest natural risk, this exercise showed to what extent our economic capital would be consumed in the event of a sudden (and unforeseen) increase in climate risk

We consider a range of potential opportunities driven by physical climate risks, including changes in temperatures, precipitation patterns and sea levels Specifically, we consider the potential for changes in physical climate parameters to present a broader series of global public health challenges, such as those relating to (1) extreme weather events, (2) decreases in water supply, (3) heat exposure and (4) declining crop yields In the short-term, extreme weather events have been prioritized as our greatest physical risk

We also consider how changes in physical and transition risks could also influence a series of socioeconomic challenges and opportunities that would likely impact the delivery of healthcare Examples could include health and hygiene issues due to migration, malnutrition, and increases in respiratory, bronchial, water-borne and other diseases Additionally, we consider how these negative societal and environmental impacts could present opportunities where Cigna, in particular, could provide products and services to help respond to these changes in physical climate parameters across the markets we serve

Our risk assessment considers all geographic locations and markets where we operate in addition to potential new markets under evaluation Additionally, we consider global environmental and socioeconomic trends, which may impact the value of our assets in addition to revenue and costs in our target markets The criteria used to determine our priorities with regards to climate change risks and opportunities include the following factors: degree of potential regulatory, physical and other business impacts to Cigna In addition to engaging with our internal stakeholders to prioritize risks and opportunities, we also monitor the activities related to climate change risk among our key stakeholders, which include investors, corporate customers and industry peers 

For example, increasing energy efficiency at our facilities has been prioritized due to (1) cost savings and risk mitigation opportunities, (2) identified value to our stakeholders and (3) alignment with our mission and the increasingly globalized nature of our operations Based on our prioritization, we have a Strategic Sustainability Performance Plan in place that includes formal policies on energy and water consumption, and direct and indirect carbon dioxide emissions

We define risk as having a substantial financial and strategic impact using both qualitative and quantitative measures Qualitative measures consider correlations to our business model, mission 
and value chain Quantitatively, we generally consider a risk to be substantive based on a scenario where at least 1% of our net income could be impacted In 2018, this threshold was approximately $25 million

Truck Insurance Exchange," As an organization, Farmers recognizes that it is essential that we consider the impact we have on the environment, and that we create and foster a culture where all individuals are aware of opportunities to conserve energy and natural resources

We have initiatives in process that reduce our carbon footprint These include changes in the way we manage our facilities, our fleet and our travel

From an energy procurement standpoint, our goal is to purchase energy in an efficient, cost effective and environmentally responsible manner, and to establish and implement effective energy management programs In 2020, we purchased 64,088,426 kWh in Renewable Energy Credits to account for the total energy use across the Farmers real estate portfolio

Farmers Insurance has implemented an enterprise-wide carbon footprint measurement platform that includes utility, paper, fleet vehicle fuel consumption, waste, and employee travel Between 2019 and 2020, Farmers reduced electricity consumption by 2219% Heating consumption for the same period went down by 3181% Overall Facilities emissions went down by 2178% between 2019 and 2020

Farmers is committed to renewable energy sources Farmers currently has solar arrays in four additional Southwest regions ranging in size from 25 KW to 240 KW to help offset energy consumption and costs

From an operating perspective and to ensure ongoing success, Farmers completes quarterly audits of HVAC and lighting schedules to ensure systems are going into setback modes during after-hour periods at all locations where Farmers has control over HVAC and lighting systems At locations where we do not manage these systems, our local Facilities team partners with property management to ensure our spaces are conditioned and lit during occupied times only

Our primary office building in Caledonia, MI completed an LED retrofit for all interior lighting as well as added multi-stream recycling in 2020

Our Caledonia, MI and Woodland Hills, CA offices participate in composting programs and prior to the pandemic, generated approximately 15,000 lbs of organic material annually that in turns gets used in farm and garden applications across the local regions

In addition to these improvements, we have also implemented programs to remind employees to power down equipment when it is not in use Many computer monitors and desktop computers are automatically set to go into a sleep or hibernation mode after a short period of inactivity

Depending on job assignment, employees may be provided with a company fleet vehicle Since 2010, more fuel efficient vehicles have been purchased for the company fleet, midsized sedans are being used instead of full-size sedans, hybrid and electric vehicles have been added to the fleet and the overall fleet size has been reduced Between 2019 and 2020, Farmers reduced its fleet by 31%, reduced its fleet miles driven 6023%, reduced gallons consumed by fleet at 5536% or 1,396,981 gallons from calendar year 2019 to calendar year 2020 Total CO2 emissions went down by 5536%

When offices were open prior to March 2020, Farmers employees that commuted to our business locations were encouraged to use ridesharing and the use of public transportation In some locations, we provide incentives including subsidies for train passes, bus passes and vanpools, free shuttle buses from train stations and preferred carpool parking spaces In March 2020, 98% of our employee based shifted to remote work  reducing employee commute by approximately 81 million miles compared to 2019

Farmers has also installed ten (8 in Southern California and 2 in Phoenix) electric charging stations to provide an energy source for those employees who already drive electric vehicles and to also encourage more environmentally friendly vehicle use In Los Angeles, we provide a company stipend to employees for alternative travel

Telepresence technology and high-quality HD video conferencing systems in many operations have helped minimize airline travel

In addition to our focus on the reduction of emissions we have made improvements in our effort to reduce water consumption Improvements include low volume sink faucets, low volume toilets and waterless urinals Other improvements within our operations include upgrades to programmable irrigation systems and pop-up sprinkler heads, which eliminate leakage and overspray We have also transitioned to xeriscape in some locations

In 2020, we achieved our goal to reduce print for internal purposes by 80% compared to a 2015 baseline Strategies around print reduction, messaging, and a majority of employees working from home led to realizing this target Copier/printer machines in many of our locations are set for duplex (two-sided) printing and the print/copy default has been set to black and white vs color Farmers has implemented an MDS optimization program within Document Logistics, replacing multi-functional devices with more energy efficient equipment This program was put into place not only to reduce energy consumption and the impact on the environment, but to also ensure cost savings We are in the fifth year of the program and continue to reduce both the number and size of the multifunction devices (MFD) in our facilities

In 2020, we were able to reduce the current fleet from 480 to 299, a 38% decrease Replacement devices are optimized based on use and are more energy efficient We continue to work on reducing utilization of paper and office supplies across the enterprise

Virtually all employee communications are handled electronically rather than through paper As of 2011, semi-monthly statements of employee earnings and deductions have been electronically available and are no longer printed and mailed to employees Farmers employee benefit statements have also transitioned from being printed and mailed to employees homes to providing the statements electronically Improved ordering processes have lowered the volume of consumable supplies in many locations Recycling programs have been implemented for paper, plastic, cardboard and glass Printer, copier ink and toner cartridges are also recycled, as are cell phones, chargers and obsolete electronic equipment such as computers and monitors In our mail rooms, we have begun recycling and reusing packing materials for shipping

We have implemented initiatives that provide customers with environmentally friendly choices that also reduce the organizations carbon footprint For example, in some operations, mail sent to agents and customers is delivered in envelopes made of recycled material A new billing system available in some states and for some products provides increased on-line billing and payment capabilities In some states and for some products, we are working to provide customers with the option to receive electronic policy forms and notices from us, rather than paper copies Customers with these electronic policies may also have the option to receive bills, pay bills and view their billing histories online Some states prohibit the use of paperless communication with policyholders, which limits our ability to consider paperless options

Our MultiCar auto policy, available in some states, can cover multiple vehicles on one policy, thereby reducing the amount of paper customers receive and our overall carbon footprint

In 2010, Farmers built a 164,000 SF facility in Oklahoma City that was recognized by the US Green Building Council as qualifying for Core and Shell LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) certification at the silver level, and also qualified for LEED certification for the Tenant Improvement portion of the project In 2020, our Phoenix office as awarded the Platinum Green Business Certification from the Phoenix Green Business Leader and our Portland office requalified for the Green Business Leader gold certification

In some of our larger facilities: 1) during building retrofits, water bottle refilling stations are added to water fountains Plastic single-use containers are no longer provided by Farmers as of 2020; 2) programmable thermostats are in place; 3) carbon footprint studies and energy audits have been completed; 4) Energy Star equipment is purchased whenever practical; 5) cleaning hours were revised to allow for more daytime cleaning, allowing us to deactivate interior lights earlier in the evening; 6) new employees are informed of our green business practices during their initial training classes and existing employees receive regular electronic communications on various energy-related topics, keeping awareness at a high level; 7) In 2016 our large facility in Washington started a composting program as part of its waste services in the café and all kitchenettes

As of 2019, we achieved our goal of eliminating single use plastic from our internal operations by working with our vendors to replace single-use plastic materials with alternative, environmentally friendly materials All single use plastic in our onsite cafés have been replaced with an alternative material We have also updated all company ordering options to remove all single use plastic offerings, such a cutlery, plastic water bottles, etc Lastly, we implemented a k-cup recycling program in our large locations

In addition the two Print and Distribution Centers in North America have implemented several significant initiatives to mitigate impacts to the environment including: aggressive approach to deliver agent, customer and broker documents electronically versus traditional USPS mail; On-line report viewing; purchasing of envelopes and stationary manufactured with paper from trees harvested from forests that are SFI (Sustainable Forestry Initiative) certified, Print-On-Demand of agent support materials versus warehoused stored materials; digitizing as much in-bound mail as possible via an active imaging approach; implemented many initiatives improving efficiency, lowering energy consumption, actively participating in operational recycling program, consolidating operations to a two-site COE model and reducing operational waste from 4% to less than 2%",0
John Hancock Life Insurance Company Of New York,"  The following are examples of risks that climate change could pose to our company:

Regulatory risks
As a global life and health insurer and wealth and asset management company, we do not anticipate being directly impacted by climate change regulations in the near term  However, certain assets in our investment portfolios could be subject to increased regulation which may result in increased operating costs  This could include, for instance, carbon pricing regimes imposed on our oil and gas investments or energy efficiency requirements in our real estate portfolio  We monitor the regulatory environment on an ongoing basis and do not deem (potential) regulations to have a material impact on our company at this time

Physical risks
Manulifes operations and investments are diversified across many sectors and geographies  So while this may expose Manulife to the effects of an environmental event in one region, its holdings in any affected region are limited and circumscribed  Nonetheless, extreme weather events may pose operational risk to Manulife and as such, we have in place business continuity procedures and regularly perform concentration risk assessments on our operations  Any financial risks of environmental impacts are further minimized through insurance and reinsurance

Other risks
Manulifes reputation may be adversely affected if it is not perceived to be taking meaningful action to help address climate change  Changing client behavior may impact demand for certain products  As an example, large corporate tenants are increasingly seeking out more environmentally sustainable office space (see answer to Question 5 for more detail)

Dakota Fire Insurance Company," Significant changes in convective storm patterns, hurricanes, and droughts could impact the way in which EMC insures property exposure over time EMC monitors long-term weather patterns and geographical concentrations of risk as part of its catastrophe and exposure management processes Historical actions have been taken to reduce exposure concentrations in some catastrophe-prone areas and to limit growth in others Exposure growth is being monitored throughout the year to ensure that exposure concentrations do not unknowingly exceed established risk tolerances 

In addition to managing exposure concentrations, EMC continues to evaluate opportunities to reduce losses from catastrophic events For example, EMC has increased deductibles and changed the way deductibles apply to commercial property policies with multiple locations EMC has also made a concerted effort to monitor insured values and make sure they are sufficient for the insured risk

EMC purchases aggregate catastrophe reinsurance as a component of its overall catastrophe management strategy In addition, EMC has protected its surplus and financial position by securing per risk and facultative reinsurance treaties on larger insured properties

Along with underwriting risk, severe weather could also have an impact on EMC corporate headquarters facilities, as well as its regional branch offices around the country  EMC has a very robust disaster recovery plan in place for each branch/
department which it is prepared to employ if and when it is necessary EMC's branch office locations, which are spread throughout the country, help to minimize the risk arising from severe weather effecting operations, as offices located in non-affected areas are available to assist the impacted offices meet the demands that would be presented if a physical office location was severely impacted by storms

All America Insurance Company,"
Centrals home office continues to reduce its carbon foot print  In November of 2009 the home office began a program to reduce electricity and natural gas consumption  From 2009 to 2012 Central reduced electric usage by 183% and natural gas usage by 225%

Because of our efforts in this area Central was recognized by the US Environmental Protection Agency as an Energy Star Building for 2011  Buildings that earn this award use a minimum of 35% less energy and generate a minimum of 35% fewer greenhouse gas emissions that similar building across the country 

In April 1, 2012 Central Insurance Companies received recognition from its electric provider, American Electric Power, for completing an energy efficiency project and reducing energy usage at it home office location in Van Wert, Ohio   

Beginning in 2003 Central embarked upon many paperless initiatives internal to our business processes and external to our independent agency channel and policyholders

AGENCY PARTNERS
In 2004 we eliminated printing and mailing all paper policy documents previously sent to agents  Agents are able to view and save policy related documents from our agent portal  We are also able to download policy information directly into various computer systems our agents use  That same year we eliminated all paper manual for our agents and our employees  That information is accessed online through our agency portal  Agents are also able to submit new applications for clients for most of our lines of business online rather than mailing those applications to us

POLICYHOLDERS
In 2008 we introduced an updated version of our policyholder portal to our market allowing policyholders 24/7 access to their insurance information  They can retrieve 2 years of policy and billing information They can pay their bill online and they can report and track a claim  69% of all premiums paid to our company are done via some form of electronic payment (EFT, E-check, debit or credit card) We introduced ebill and epolicy in 2009 and 2010 allowing policyholders to turn off paper documents  In 2011 we introduced an I-phone app of our consumer portal and in 2012 we introduced a mobile app for the Android platform  Some states have recently published plans to allow a mobile id card as valid proof of insurance; proof our actions to support a mobile platform have value to the market place and environment  To date about 25% of our Personal lines and Commercial lines policyholders access the consumer portal to interact with their insurance needs

INTERNAL PROCESSES
All underwriting and claim files are created and stored electronically  Emails and fax are seamlessly attached to electronic files without printing paper  Major vendors are required to communicate with us electronically as well  We monitor postage, paper and printing costs quarterly by employee and business unit  Each operating unit has authority to develop and implement a workflow solution that reduces paper

Lastly, fuel efficiency in our corporate fleet offerings is one of several important factors when considering our fleet vehicles  The Company continues to downsize vehicles offered  We also have begun offering 4-cylinder vehicles where appropriate

As a result of the Companys post-Superstorm Sandy review of its Business Continuity Plans and the reported damage incurred by neighboring facilities, the Company added improvements to its Corporate Headquarters, which included the installation of additional drains and pumps to mitigate the risk of flooding, the raising of fuel pumps for generator operations and ensuring redundant electrical circuits to provide power from emergency generators 
The post-Superstorm Sandy review also identified a concern with the location of the Companys designated Recovery Center for its mainframe applications in New Jersey  The area in which the Recovery Center is located was heavily flooded, although the Recovery Center itself was not flooded nor its operations interrupted  After careful analysis, the Company determined that there was a risk that the Companys Home Office, its National Telecommunications and Conference Center and its designated Recovery Center could be affected by the same storm or incident, such as a wide-spread power outage and not available for an extended period of time  Given the risk, the Company determined that it would be prudent to move its recovery center to a facility operated by the same vendor that is located in Arizona, which is on the Western Power Grid  In January 2015, the Company completed the successful changeover from its prior mainframe disaster recovery site to it new site in Arizona  Moving the Recovery Center to Arizona mitigates the risk that the Home Office the National Telecommunications and Conference Center and the designated Recovery Center would be affected by the same storm or incident
The Company conducts at least two disaster recovery tests during the year  The tests conducted since the relocation of the Recovery Center to Arizona have been successful

Asuris Health Northwest,"
Climate change risk currently ranks lower on the risk spectrum when compared to liquidity, durations, interest rate, and asset class

Furthermore from an investment portfolio standpoint we believe any risks or opportunities associated with climate change, such as carbon and water restrictions, are generally priced into the cost of the investment through the market; any potential arbitrage opportunities would have imbedded investment risk which we believe to be inappropriate for us to take given our overall risk tolerance profile

Given the nature of our underwritten liability we do not currently assess the correlation between climate risks our underwriting and investments Due to the relative short-tailed liability associated with the health underwriting risk profile we believe it is not as critical as it would be for a life company, or P&C company, to structure our portfolio with a similar duration

United American Insurance Co,"  Climate change regulations can pose risks to the operations and financial performance of issuers across a broad array of sectors and subsectors, including but not limited to utilities, energy, automotive, agriculture, materials, consumer and industrial manufacturing, real estate, and insurance  Industries which are most at risk from potential burdensome regulations in the near-term are those that negatively affect air and resource quality  Certain industries are exposed to additional risks from climate change, including changes in energy demand for heating and cooling, peak hydrocarbon demand, weather-driven variability in agricultural production and water availability, rising sea levels, and extreme weather events

We have considered climate change risks for all asset classes and continue to closely monitor and evaluate industry trends, regulations, and long-term risks associated with climate change for all of our holdings 
The Companies have adapted their investment strategy to account for issuer-specific risks associated with climate change and climate change regulations  As an example, utility investments are evaluated based upon their generation mix and carbon intensity  Energy investments are made with consideration for potential greenhouse gas emissions regulations and downside risks to global oil demand

Auto related investments are contemplated with consideration for the ongoing transition to hybrid and electric vehicles  Investment in property and casualty insurers are evaluated in light of their environmental risk management practices  Environmental stewardship, geographical diversification, and long-term sustainability are key considerations for all new investments and the Companies continue to monitor and assess risks driven by climate change and related regulatory interventions

HealthSpring Life & Health Insurance Company," Climate change is one risk that would be considered
Cignas general account investment portfolio consists predominately of fixed-income assets While the primary risks Cigna undertakes are credit related, climate change can play a role in our evaluation of the creditworthiness of specific issuers and industries Risk factors may include:

	Changes in supply/demand for fuel (eg, oil, natural gas);
	Developments in renewable energy sources; and
	Effects of extreme weather events on industries and issuers

We have not identified any significant risks posed by our business to the environment Our determination that there are no environmental risks posed by our operations that would have a substantive impact on the environment is consistent with and supported by the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board Materiality Map, which indicates that environmental risks are generally not financially material for companies within the Insurance sector of the Financial Services industry, such as FNF",0
Farmers Mutual Hail Ins.

First Specialty Insurance Corporation," We engage with policy makers at international and national levels, business leaders in the insurance industry and other sectors, multilateral organizations, NGOs, and others

Much of the work Swiss Re does at the policy-maker level around the globe on the climate change topic aims to encourage a better understanding of the need for action as well as how the insurance industry can contribute from the perspective of a provider of risk transfer, a risk manager and as an investor Swiss Re generally works to support actions to help move the debate in the right direction rather than giving support for specific pieces of legislation For example, in Europe, we have continued to raise awareness of the important role insurers play in mitigating climate risk through different interactions with policy makers This includes speaking at industry conferences (Insurance Europe and the ABI), presenting at the European Commissions DG Climate Actions working group on Climate Adaptation and engaging bilaterally with the European Commission and national governments In the US, we have maintained regular dialogue with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC), principally on climate change and natural catastrophes In Switzerland, we have provided a committee member to the OcCC (Organe consultatif sur les changements climatiques), an advisory body on climate change set up by the Swiss Federal Administration

Memberships of organisations such as The Climate Group allow for periodic dialogues on climate-related topics, (predominantly resilience and risk transfer themes) with regional, national and state governments which are also members At the UN climate summit in September 2014, Swiss Re pledged its financial capacity as well as its expertise to help nations increase their climate resilience through the following commitment: ""By the year 2020, Swiss Re commits to having advised 50 sovereigns and sub-sovereigns on climate risk resilience, and to have offered them protection of USD 10bn against climate related risks"": wwwswissrecom/rethinking/climate_and_natural_disaster_risk/Swiss_Re_at_UN_Climate_Summithtml

In 2015, Swiss Re partnered with Standard & Poor's in a special project to quantify the impact of natural catastrophes and climate change on sovereign ratings Based on a sample of 38 countries, our simulations indicate that natural disasters (earthquakes, tropical storms, floods and winter storms) of a severity that is likely to occur once every 250 years can indeed weaken the affected sovereign's rating by up to 15 notches The study also finds that the potential effect of climate change on their ratings can be significantly reduced by catastrophe insurance  This study is aligned to more than one aspect of our business as it informs countries about their exposure to extreme weather It also helps inform the private sector in these countries about the importance of climate change adaptation 

Swiss Re regularly publishes on weather and climate related topics and supports the publication of reports by external organizations  Swiss Re also provided research and expertise for the COP21 Climate Change Conference in Paris in December 2015

Swiss Re continues to share our data on the potential impact of major natural catastrophe events on cities through a number of publications Following on from last years publication Mind the risk: a global ranking of cities under threat from natural disasters, we extended our Risky Cities series in 2015, providing more detailed data for Istanbul and Bangkok These studies are publicly available on our website (http://wwwswissrecom/rethinking/climate_and_natural_disaster_risk/)

The Exchange has also encouraged our policyholders to pay online to reduce paper mailing, reducing waste and carbon emissions 

The Exchange was the first carrier to receive approval from the California Department of Insurance to introduce a Verified Mileage program, providing lower premiums for policyholders who confirm the number of miles they drive annually by providing odometer readings We have since implemented this program in several other markets, including Texas, Missouri, and Illinois This voluntary program provides an incentive in the form of lower insurance premiums for drivers to reduce their carbon footprint by driving less

Additionally, the Exchanges affiliation with the Auto Club means that there are number of other steps taken to engage key constituencies 

The Auto Club both provides information to the public and advocates for public policies and appropriate funding related to transportation, automobile use, fuels and propulsion systems, fuel efficiency, emissions, and climate change We publicize these issues and our efforts in Auto Club publications (eg Westways and Journey magazines) distributed to about half of all households in our Southern California service area (and members in other states as well) Our regular articles on these topics are intended to increase our members awareness of climate change, environmental, transportation, automotive, and related topics The following articles are some examples:

- Fun on Electric Bikes  Nov/Dec 2018 
- A Guide to Your EPA Window Sticker  March/April 2019
- Green Car Guide  May 2019 

The Automotive Research Center (ARC) develops and distributes materials educating members on how to conserve fuel in the way they drive, maintain, and operate their vehicles The ARC distributes the annual AAA National brochure The Gas Watchers Guide which provides information for motorists about how to use less fuel This brochure is distributed to AAA Branches, including locations in CA, TX, MO, IL, NM, HI, AL, KY, OH, PA, ME, NH, and VT as well as on AAAcom

The ARC published the inaugural Green Car Guide in 2010, and it is now an annual publication and available nationwide These materials are distributed through our AAA Branches, and available on our Website Members can also use a searchable website database at AAAcom/greencar to easily find information on the green vehicles that we were tested The results of the Green Car Guide tests are also announced through the media to reach a wider audience 

Starting in 2018, the ARC, in partnership with AAA National, regularly tests vehicles for fuel economy and emissions The results are compared with the fuel economy and emissions ratings for these vehicles to determine if there are any discrepancies In addition, the ARC has developed its own drive-cycles for use on the dyno, based on real-world driving, in order to further study the fuel economy and emissions of these vehicles

The following resources are available online and provide more information on the Auto Club's support for balanced, safe, environmentally sound, and responsible transportation improvements, and for the wise and effective use of taxes and fees paid by motorists and others for transportation projects and services

We recognize the potential impact of climate change on our insurance book of business, the publics perception of corporate social responsibility and the regulatory environment related to climate change, including the potential impact on the value of securities issued by an entity and held in our investment portfolio

Climate change has the potential to significantly alter global weather patterns, possibly producing more frequent and/or more intense severe convective storms and hurricanes More intense storms may elevate the risk of both coastal and riverine flooding Wildfires could become more frequent and more difficult to control as drought patterns change Winter storms could drive cold weather conditions further south and into areas that are less prepared   For all of these potential weather changes, we utilize various commercially licensed software models and data to better understand the potential impact that adverse weather may have on policies we insure We also continue to monitor scientific progress to determine how climate change may impact CNA in ways not specifically accounted for by the models

With respect to operating risk, we have a Business Resiliency Program that is designed to protect employees and reputation, while keeping CNAs operations functioning at a level acceptable for serving our policyholders and shareholders in the event of a business interruption, regardless of cause As part of this program, we seek to ensure that our facilities have adequate back-up in place for data, access to IT infrastructure, remote application access, etc, so that we can respond quickly to climate-related emergencies without major disruption to our business processes These contingency plans are frequently tested and have occasionally been used in extreme weather-related incidents

We utilize our software models to determine the potential impact of weather events on all of our facilities We use this information to prioritize mitigation efforts, improve employee safety, and improve business resiliency

When evaluating investment decisions, we typically review information in the public domain, as well as in offering documents that detail the risks posed by the investment These disclosures usually include details surrounding the legislative risk posed by climate-related legislation (eg, introduction of a carbon tax for industries and activities that emit significant amounts of carbon dioxide, cap and trade legislation that sets allowable limits for emissions of carbon dioxide at a mandated cap while allowing for the trading of permits among industries to encourage lower emissions, etc), dependencies on various environmentally sensitive pricing (eg, commodity or energy prices), sensitivity to weather-related phenomena (eg, insurance or reinsurance company investments, hurricane exposure to offshore energy facilities, etc) and the like The amount of disclosure and the decision whether or not to buy or sell an investment in light of the risk (or lack thereof) will vary on a case by case basis

New York Marine & General Insurance Company,"
For example, we always encourage our auto policyholders to use telematics, not only because it makes drivers safer, but also because it encourages drivers to be more fuel efficient (wasteful speeding and rapid starts/stops are recorded) We also advise our fleet clients of risk management best practices, such as selecting drivers based upon their driving histories, including but not limited to speeding and reckless driving (which wastes fuel and results in greater emissions)
Our insureds understand that more miles driven and unnecessary personal use of company vehicles by employees increases their exposure to risk and usually their premium as well Insureds may be advised that reducing unnecessary miles driven and personal use of company vehicles by employees can reduce their premiums and also have a positive impact on climate change by reducing fuel usage and emissions
During our property surveys we always look at the age and condition of HVAC systems, electrical services, etc When these systems exceed 20 years of age, they are more likely to produce property claims from fires, etc When we identify these conditions, it is our standard practice to recommend that the client replace or upgrade their systems with units meeting current codes and standards Although we dont specifically ask insureds to replace old inefficient systems for efficiency purposes, our practices does have the effect of encouraging insureds to replace older systems with newer ones (which are also more efficient in virtually all cases) The use of LED lighting in warehouses is another example where ProSight and other insurers encourage clients to replace older, (inefficient & dangerous) metal halide lighting with newer systems that save tremendous amounts of energy (and are safer)  Additionally, loss control surveys also include assessment of risk exposures including vulnerability to flooding, power outages, brush fires, etc If we find situations which warrant improvement, we make recommendations to client to help them reduce chances of loss This has the side benefit of helping them deal more effectively with the impacts of climate change on their local environment

American Republic Ins Co," We believe current risks associated with climate change present minimal risk related to our business, including financial implications",3
Jefferson Ins Co," Investment management is an integral part of our business Understanding the extent and how climate change will impact the value of investments is crucial Concerns about climate change are changing the way assets are managed and giving rise to new and alternative asset classes, especially in the field of renewable energy and carbon investments We are committed to integrating climate change  among other environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors - into our proprietary investment strategies and third-party asset management Customer demand, a growing recognition of the importance of ESG factors and better risk-adjusted returns are sound business reasons for integrating ESG factors in our investments By scrutinizing investments from an ESG perspective, we endeavor to identify long-term risks and opportunities that are not fully reflected in market prices and seek to capitalize on them for the benefit of shareholders, customers and other stakeholders This is especially relevant to us, because as an insurance company we manage and carry risk over very long time horizons  We are increasingly demonstrating our commitment to ESG by incorporating these factors in our investment strategies and asset management 
As a leading global insurance company and one of the world's top five asset managers, we are aware of the potential impact of our investment decisions We take seriously the responsibility that comes with the investment side of our business and are committed to systematically addressing controversial topics by integrating ESG considerations into our investment processes 
Sustainability in Proprietary Asset Management:
With proprietary assets of over 530 billion across a range of asset classes, sectors and countries, we are directly and indirectly connected with other businesses, sectors and economies, and are therefore an integral part of the globalized economy 
We strive to invest sustainably across all asset classes over time The practical implementation of sustainability in proprietary asset management involves integrating ESG factors into our investment process, for example through research, corporate and country analysis, asset manager selection, monitoring and risk management We firmly believe that considering ESG factors in investment management is not a short-term trend and over time will fundamentally change business, and consequently, investment performance 
Throughout 2013, we have developed an ESG Directive for Investments, which aims to integrate ESG as a standard practice into the management of Allianz insurance investment portfolios The Directive will be implemented in a step-by-step manner (2014-15) and intends to: 
Include ESG questions in the asset manager selection process
Assign asset managers to apply tailored ESG policies to the portfolios that they manage on behalf of Allianz
Include ESG-related topics during annual asset manager reviews 

Due to the range of asset classes we own around the world, the Directive does not provide a one- size fits all solution or standardized approach to ESG that all asset managers have to implement Instead, the responsibility for defining the best or most suitable ESG approach for a specific investment portfolio rests with the respective asset manager 
ESG factors are considered in investment processes for alternative investments, such as renewable energy, infrastructure investments, and real estate We are preparing the integration of ESG considerations into remaining asset classes in 2014 in line with our ESG Directive 
Furthermore, we continue to promote sustainable business practices within the companies we invest in Our approach is to seek dialogue to overcome challenges to sustainability For example we engaged with controversial sectors, such as extractive industries As a global investor we can have significant influence and we see it as our responsibility to promote sustainable business practices within the companies we invest in Our approach is to seek dialogue to overcome challenges to sustainability Throughout 2013, we have for example engaged with a major Asian energy company regarding environmental and HampS practices Furthermore, we successfully implemented an environment, social and governance (ESG) dialogue format, which continually engages a group of German and international NGOs The goal of this exchange is to establish an evidence-based dialogue built on trust and mutual understanding This allows our NGO partners to directly address Allianz with their concerns and gives Allianz the opportunity to listen and understand their different perspectives We can also tap into the expertise of NGO partners when formulating ESG positions and guidelines, incorporating their direct, on-the-ground experience of various topics Our ESG dialogue is part of our new ESG framework for the Allianz Group In this area, we plan to develop a formal ESG engagement framework to strengthen and standardize our approach to engagement with companies 
Acknowledging Boundaries:
As described above, engagement is particularly important for asset classes or investments where we cannot avoid indirect exposure to issues that could be considered controversial For example, due to our size we rely on broad indices with high liquidity as benchmarks for our large-scale investments While we need such instruments for diversification and hedging purposes, we have no influence on their composition Therefore we look to initiate and take part in dialogue with providers of such indices to determine how ESG issues can be integrated
Furthermore, as a large institutional investor, we aim to diversify our portfolio across many different sectors and companies Although some of these sectors are fundamental to economic progress, they are also prone to negative ESG impacts and may be controversial A typical example relates to fossil fuel generated power While there is the need to combat climate change, the rising global energy demand cannot be fulfilled without energy generated from fossil fuels For instance, renewable energy generation can be intermittent, so there is still a need for flexible back up from conventional energy sources when renewable energy supply cannot meet demand The use of fossil fuels will continue for the foreseeable future in order to meet rising global energy demand While we recognize the impacts of fossil fuels, we are not in a position to avoid such sectors as a general principle (as for example we do in the context of banned weapons, which our ESG process governs through a Group-wide exclusion applied to our proprietary investments, subject to limitations we are working to overcome when restricted companies are listed on major stock exchange indices, or where Allianz invests in investment funds managed by other organizations) As a result, and even though it might be perceived as a contradictory, we invest in both renewable and non-renewable sources of energy We see both sides of the argument  the need to contribute to global energy security and to economic development that relies on energy use, while also maintaining our commitment to contribute to a low-carbon economy
By the very nature of our business, insurance companies are also large- scale institutional investors and we take our responsibility as a provider of capital seriously Investment decisions are based on a systematic approach considering the potential risks and opportunities that could affect particular issuers and industries including considerations of climate change and other relevant ESG aspects material to the specific investment Going forward, we believe that an increasingly robust analysis of ESG-related issues is fundamental to understanding the long-term performance of investments We consider carbon being among the relevant environmental aspects for some investments, specifically for certain issuers and industries However, we do not consider carbon to be a steering metric for driving all investment decisions given the diversity of our investment portfolio, regulatory requirements and the fiduciary duty to our clients Additionally, the sole knowledge of carbon emissions would be a too narrow view - more importantly we need to understand the climate change context and adaptation strategies of issuers What is more, current levels of carbon emissions can lead to wrong conclusions as the competitive situation, regulatory environment, investments made and the long-term reduction path also need to be taken into account On top of this, there is no robust methodology and practicable approach, from an effort/ benefit perspective, available supporting the calculation of carbon footprint of investments Also, the availability and quality of carbon data is still insufficient Proposed approaches such as applying estimations and carbon footprint averages for whole industries reduce the meaningfulness of the information and, we do not deem it appropriate to base investment decisions on low quality data
Governance: 
At Allianz, all ESG related integration-activities (including with respect to climate change and investments) are centrally coordinated by the Group ESG Board, established in 2012 The ESG Board consists of three Allianz SE board members, responsible for the proprietary investments of Allianz, the asset management of Allianz as well as global corporate insurance lines The ESG Board determines yearly work-plans and holds ultimate accountability for integrating and strengthening ESG aspects within our insurance and investing activities 
The ESG Board meets quarterly and reports to the Group Finance and Risk Committee for decision-making Besides the designated ESG Board, several committees with Board member leadership play an important role in our decision-making processes: 
Group Finance and Risk Committee: controls adherence to the principles of the Group-wide capital- and liquidity planning as well as the investment strategy and prepares the risk strategy This includes establishing and controlling a Group-wide risk management and risk controlling system, also including sustainability risk The committee is also the decision- making body for ESG-related topics, based on analysis and deliberations within the ESG Board 
Group Investment Committee: oversees and reviews the investment activities of Allianz SE and Group companies in order to implement the Group Investment Strategy The committee also decides on concrete investment frameworks for covered investment assets 
In addition, several Board members assume direct responsibility for specific sustainability topics Functional departments also provide regular updates on sustainability issues directly to the Board 
With regard to responsible investment, the ESG Board: determines the overall ambition level for ESG integration into AZ proprietary investments; determines the specific ESG requirements towards Asset Managers, which will be incorporated in the RfP process and the Asset Manager selection process for new mandates; and receives regular updates on status of implementation and decides further implementation steps 
Board Members:
The Allianz SE Board Member responsible for Investments is responsible for ensuring that respective ESG Board decisions which regard responsible investment are carried out, and thus oversees the process of the ESG integration into Allianz' insurance investment portfolios 
AIlianz Investment Management (AIM) Leadership:
At Allianz, investment management is performed by a global function, Allianz Investment Management (AIM) It manages all assets covering the liabilities of all Allianz Group insurance companies AIM is responsible Asset-Liability Management, Investment Strategy and Asset Manager Management The latter includes the complete process of mandating internal/external Asset Managers for the management of Allianz assets
The CIO of Allianz Investment Management (AIM) obtains operative responsibility for carrying out ESG integration measures The CFO of Allianz Investment Management (AIM) obtains monitoring responsibility of the ESG integration into investments He further coordinates (1) the efforts of AIM Financial Control (AIM FC) in implementing concrete ESG requirements for the assets of Allianz insurance investment portfolios (proprietary assets); and (2) the efforts of AIM Asset Manager Management (AIM AMM) to consider the ESG approach and resources in the selection and regular reviews of Asset Managers 
Portfolio Managers/ external managers: 
Per the ESG Directive for Investments, all Asset Managers investing Allianz insurance investment portfolios are systematically assigned to develop and implement an ESG approach (process started in Q4 2013, to be completed throughout 2014-15) 

Due to the range of asset classes we own around the world, the Directive does not provide a one-size fits all solution or standardized approach to ESG that all asset managers have to implement Instead, the responsibility for defining the best or most suitable ESG approach for a specific investment portfolio rests with the respective asset manager 
Implementation is carried out by our mandated Asset Managers 
Carbon Investments:
Allianz is operating on a carbon neutral basis since 2012 In addition to continually reducing carbon emissions from our own operations, we offset remaining emissions through direct investments in carbon reduction initiatives, which generate CO2 certificates Investments to date include forest protection projects in Kenya and Indonesia (according to the UN, global deforestation is advancing alarmingly and currently accounts for around 17% of global greenhouse gas emissions) and an energy efficiency program in India, described below  Any remaining certificates after we offset our carbon footprint can be sold on the European carbon market to generate a financial return The carbon reduction projects we have invested in include:
Wildlife Works Carbon LLC (WWC): Through acquisition of a 10% share in this developer of REDD projects (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation) we are supporting a forest protection project in Kenya WWC projects meet strict sustainability criteria and are the first of their kind to generate CO2 certificates By investing in WWC, we are highlighting REDD projects as an attractive investment option since they combine a high level of social and ecological responsibility with competitive returns for investors
Rimba Raya: In 2013, Allianz invested in the Rimba Raya (translated as eternal forest) project in Borneo (Indonesia), the world's first REDD project to bear the triple CCB Gold Label (Climate, Community amp Biodiversity Alliance) and the first that can generate certificates in line with the market-leading VCS (Voluntary Carbon Standard) With this investment, Allianz helps prevent deforestation of 64,000 hectares of forest avoiding the release of 90 million tons of CO2 
C-Quest Capital LLC (CQC): We are financing an energy-efficiency program implemented by CQC in India The program replaces incandescent light bulbs in private households with more energy-efficient and long-lasting compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs) The program allows private households to purchase CFLs at a greatly discounted price, enabling them to lower their energy bills and improving energy efficiency in a country that frequently experiences energy shortages
Investments in Renewable Energy: 
Concerns about climate change are changing the way assets are managed and have given rise to new, alternative asset classes, especially in the field of renewable energy and carbon Allianz is an early investor in these new asset classes, and as a result we have already gained valuable experience and are benefiting from the opportunities they offer We see renewables as an investment opportunity with an attractive risk-return profile and are expanding our investments Investments in renewable energy projects are expected to provide sound returns in the long run (renewable energy investments with a maturity of 25+ years are typical), which fits well with Allianzs long-term investment strategy, which calls for manageable risks and attractive returns for durations of 20 years or more  For these reasons, Allianz is aiming for additional volume of around 400mn a year in direct investments in renewable energy projects
As large institutional investors, insurance companies are important players in financing a low-carbon economy Since 2005, we have made direct investments in renewable energy projects and the total invested by the end of 2013 was 17 billion, making Allianz one of the largest investors in this field Our renewable energy portfolio now includes over 42 wind and 7 solar parks in Germany, France, and Italy and Sweden with a total asset base of over 1000MW of generating capacity  including 250MW from wind projects acquired in 2013 Group centers of competence like Allianz Climate Solutions and Allianz Center for Technology provide a comprehensive view of the risks associated with renewable energy technologies to ensure that Allianzs clean energy investments are sound investments with stable returns At present, Allianzs renewable energy investments are realizing return of between 6 and 8%  much higher than many other asset classes  and uncorrelated with the ups and downs of the financial markets
Investments placed on behalf of Allianzs US insurance operating entities continue to play a role in the Groups renewable energy finance position In 2012, Allianz Life Insurance Company of North America joined more than a dozen US insurance groups that invested $681 million in the Topaz Solar Farms as part of the California Organized Investment Network By producing a projected 550MW of electricity, Topaz will help the state comply with the California Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS), which requires that by December 31, 2020, each California investor-owned utility must procure at least 33 percent of its retail electricity sales from renewable energy sources 
In 2013, Allianz Life invested $80M in three additional renewable energy projects, including:
The Tenaska Imperial South (Csolar IV South) project - located in Californias Imperial Valley - and its nearly 2 million solar panels that can generate enough electricity (130 MW) to power approximately 44,000 homes The project began full commercial operation in early November 213 and has a 25-year power purchase agreement with San Diego Gas and Electric (SDGampE) 
The Solar Star projects, co-located in Kern and Los Angeles counties in California, that will deliver 579MW from more than 17 million solar modules, when complete 
Continental Wind, a 667 MW portfolio of 13 operational wind farms located across the USA
Real Estate:
Allianz manages a global real estate portfolio of currently around 30 billion, mainly in continental Europe Allianz Real Estate (ARE), a subsidiary of the Allianz Group and a leading international real estate investment and asset manager, continues to expand its worldwide-diversified real estate portfolio Allianz Real Estate of America, acting as a principal on behalf of the Allianz Group insurance companies, makes equity investments and provides commercial mortgages in the American markets  including a US commercial loan portfolio in excess of $6 billion on behalf of Allianz Life Insurance Company of North America and Fireman's Fund  
Independently and as part of the Groups Risk Governance Structure as explained in response to question three (3) of this survey, ARE considers a variety of climate change related factors when assessing potential building investments, including for example the impact of natural catastrophes and climate impacts that contribute to high risk areas that may be excluded 
While adapting to physical impacts of climate change, real estate also needs to be part of the equation for climate and energy solutions  as buildings account for nearly 40% of both greenhouse gas emissions and energy consumption in the US, and globally An ARE pilot program in 2010 found that up to a 23 percent reduction in energy consumption and related carbon emissions could be achieved with relatively small investments Together with our tenants, we can work to increase energy efficiency and reduce carbon emissions
The ARE Sustainability Program:
ARE has a comprehensive sustainability program in place, with a focus on environmental factors, to support our Group commitment to significantly reduce carbon emissions and meet the demand for sustainable real estate 
The Allianz Real Estate sustainability program focuses on our core processes and creates a baseline and standards to assess our real estate's sustainability performance Environmental factors, such as energy consumption and carbon emissions, are the main focus area, which not only help our sustainability performance but also help to reduce operating cost for tenants, many of whom are Allianz entities 
The main activities of the Allianz Real Estate sustainability program are: 
Create Transparency 
Introduce common metrics for real estate sustainability
Assess and measure the sustainability status of ARE's real estate portfolio in a standardized way
Include sustainability in ARE's portfolio reporting 
Investment Management 
Include sustainability criteria in investment decision-making
Check the sustainability performance of new real estate investments as part of the acquisition process
Include energy efficiency and other sustainability topics in the due diligence process
Mandatory green building certification for new or refurbished assets (eg LEED, BREAM) 

Asset management 
Improve communication between ARE and tenants to improve sustainability performance
Include property-specific sustainability strategies into business plans Include energy efficiency into target setting with property and facility managers 
Assess individual properties' sustainability status using the Green Rating method (see below) 
Property management 
Measure, collect and report building information according to sustainability metrics 
Implement specific improvement measures in property planning Proactively suggest measures to further optimize buildings' sustainability performance 
Working with Policymakers amp Tenants:
Although the influence of sustainable properties has yet to fully materialize in the value of real estate, we see that regulatory requirements and changing market demand, especially on the tenant side, will force real estate owners to improve the environmental impact of their portfolios in the future  ARE actively engages with its tenants to further enhance the sustainability performance of its buildings  at the same time helping tenants to reduce their operating costs  ARE is taking the following measures to respond to changing customer behavior within our global real estate portfolio: upgrading properties (retrofit and refurbishment), adjusting portfolio strategy, and engaging with policy makers on related code and other mandates and incentives In general, tenants are developing a growing demand for sustainable space and energy efficient space  and ARE estimates that up to 5% of its current annual asset volume is required to comply with local regulations and to attract and meet the requirements of tenants demanding sustainable and energy-efficient properties
Standards amp Ratings: 
ARE is a founding member of the Green Rating Alliance (GRA), a European association of real estate owners and investors, auditors, industry bodies, measurement organizations and technology providers GRA has developed the Green Rating system, which provides a consistent approach to assessing, benchmarking and improving the environmental performance of existing buildings The Green Rating covers six core areas: energy, carbon, water, transport, wellbeing and waste ARE has assessed many of the existing commercial properties under management and all new investments using the Green Rating system Of all assets acquired since 2008, more than 20% have ""green credentials"" (eg Green Building Certification, Environmental Rating) 

From a risk perspective, Firemans Fund also houses significant green building expertise and plays a leading role in standards development, continuing to serve in 2013 as the first insurer elected to the US Green Building Councils National Board of Directors, thereby helping to shape the risk and value methodology behind the global expansion of the LEED green building standard 
Applicable sustainability standards vary around the world and within the United States, and are developing rapidly Concerned real estate managers and insurers are working with energy and building code regulators to find operating cost reductions aimed at carbon reduction and climate change objectives, alongside broader energy, environment and sustainability priorities Its essential that the insurance industry and its regulators work to consolidate and improve the many government and industry-led sustainable real estate standards, codes, and related performance and disclosure systems around common objectives and best practices, rather than create additional layers of reporting and requirements that may conflict with or duplicate existing efforts For real estate markets to internalize sustainable value drivers, the underlying standards, tools and reporting programs need to be clear and consistent 
Sustainability in 3rd Party Asset Management:
Allianz Asset Management (AAM), one of the worlds top five asset managers, is responsible for our third-party asset management business as well as for managing the majority of our proprietary assets AAM is home to two asset managers: Allianz Global Investors (AllianzGI) and PIMCO, a multi-asset global solutions provider 
Although these two subsidiaries have different regional focuses and investment strategies, embedding Environment, Social and Governance (ESG) issues into asset management and offering corresponding products and services is common practice in both Building strong ESG research capabilities, engaging with the companies they invest in and pursuing active share ownership through proxy voting, are at the heart of their ESG strategies
We manage a growing portfolio of Sustainable and Responsible Investments (SRI) By the end of 2013, total SRI assets managed by Allianz Asset Management (AAM) amounted to 957 billion, corresponding to 6% of AAMs total assets under management 
The largest share of AAMs total SRI assets under management are managed by PIMCO By the end of 2013, PIMCOs SRI investments totaled 782 billion (2012: 491 billion) In addition, Allianz Global Investors (AllianzGI) managed 175 billion (2012: 153 billion) of SRI investments, including the newly launched Renewable Energy Fund (AREF), which has so far attracted approximately 140mn in commitments from institutional investors 
A number of factors have driven this increase: SRI screening was introduced following a review of the investment criteria for some of the assets managed for Allianz Group; general market appreciation; and inflows of new assets from our third-party customers (including new customers) especially into fixed-income SRI products

Allianz GI:
AllianzGI seeks to be a leader in integrating ESG across the investment value chain:
1    Upstream - participating in multi-stakeholder initiatives to improve market governance
2    As an Investor - integrating ESG factors in its investment decisions
3    Downstream - encouraging improved governance and ESG performance of investee companies 
A global ESG team is responsible for ESG research, engagement and proxy voting, and ESG advisory services The teams services are utilized across our global investment platform, not just for our sustainable and responsible investment (SRI) portfolios They are also made available to the wider investment platform for use and consideration in mainstream investments
ESG Research:
Research is the cornerstone of our investment process at AllianzGI and ESG research is a component of equal importance We conduct proprietary, in-house qualitative and quantitative ESG analysis on a global universe of companies, sovereigns, covered bonds, government linked entities (agencies) and supranationals We apply both a quantitative and qualitative approach to identify and weigh material ESG factors for all business sectors and apply a best in class approach What is more, our proprietary research is also informed by external research 
Corporate Governance  proxy voting and engagement:
We have a policy in place and actively seek dialogue with companies we invest in AllianzGI has a proxy voting process in place with the Global Proxy Voting Committee and Global Corporate Governance Guidelines to provide for oversight and guidance to our Regional Proxy Voting Committees within our regional offices We want to ensure proxy voting decisions are in the best interest of our clients and take into account the most important ESG issues
When evaluating ESG issues, AllianzGI considers information from many sources, including our independent global proxy research provider, the relevant portfolio management team, the main analyst responsible for monitoring a particular company, the management of the company, and shareholder groups Engagement at AllianzGI involves two-way interaction with a company, either through presenting a viewpoint, seeking change or monitoring and documenting results We see that company engagement can improve ESG performance and reduce material ESG risks in owned companies
Beyond engagement with individual companies, other areas of ESG engagement include public policy initiatives and collective investor and multi-stakeholder engagement We feel that by selectively engagi",4

Sun Life and Health Insurance Company U.S.,"S) The Company is wholly-owned by Sun Life Financial Inc (SLF Inc)

Sun Life has expanded the scope of its environmental reporting through a greenhouse gas (GHG) Framework which includes completed data collection and GHG emissions calculations for years 2007 through 2017 for its Real Estate Investment portfolio and leased properties in Canada, for years 2013 through 2017 for its United States (US) Real Estate Investment portfolio and for years 2014 through 2017 for its International Corporate Real Estate and Investments portfolio and corporate travel As we continue to collect consumption data and calculate emissions, we expect to develop a deeper understanding of our emissions sources and opportunities for reduction or mitigation 
Building on the significant progress made in 2016 to expand the scope of our environmental reporting, in 2017, Sun Life committed to short- and long-term global GHG reduction targets: reduce our GHG emissions intensity by 20% by 2020, and 30% by 2030 (relative to a 2014 baseline) 

Our total targeted global GHG emissions intensity decreased by 147% as of the end of 2017, compared to our 2014 baseline year While we have made strong progress, we anticipate that the level of effort, investment and commitment required to reach our 2020 and 2030 targets will increase over time We view these targets as ambitious, but achievable Our year-over-year decrease in targeted global GHG emissions intensity was 26%, keeping us on-track to exceed our 2020 target These reductions are the result of proactive energy and resource management in the investment portfolio, the implementation of tenant and employee engagement programs, and leveraging advanced data analytics to optimize building performance

Our target is composed of GHG emissions resulting from energy, water, and waste (where weight data exists), and normalized to remove the impact of changing weather, occupancy and exceptional loads, for Canada, United States and International Real Estate Investment properties where Sun Life has financial control, and global corporate real estate properties >40,000 ft² where Sun Life has financial control, and is measured on an intensity basis (tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent per square foot) relative to a 2014 baseline  Year-over-year reductions are calculated annually and cumulatively reported against the 2014 baseline Reported reductions account for the purchase of renewable energy credits and carbon offsets (net, market-based reporting)

Sun Life continues to focus on opportunities to reduce energy consumption and, in turn, to reduce GHG emissions Between 2015 and 2017, we achieved a 5% reduction in energy use intensity across our combined global corporate real estate and Real Estate Investment portfolio Our energy use intensity is declining as we continue to implement energy-efficiency projects and innovative energy management programs, and build employee and tenant awareness of their roles in reducing energy consumption",0

"Arcadian Health Plan, Inc.","  Humana is committed to integrating green building principles into our existing and new portfolio of facilities with a focus on energy and water efficiency Humana advanced this objective through the integration of climate and sustainability factors such as energy efficiency projects at our facilities, access to transportation, Energy Star or LEED guidelines, employee engagement (ie, behavioral change) and other parameters, into the decision criteria used to improve our facility portfolio and select future Humana locations  Opportunities for improving the portfolio and achieving energy and GHG reduction goals are identified by the Workplace Solutions team in collaboration with our external consulting partners  Initiatives may be evaluated and presented to the senior management for support and funding including capital investment, associate involvement (ie, resource support) or other requirements  

Our short-term strategy is informed by our environmental goals, influencing our team to focus on energy efficient operations within our owned and leased facilities, spurring direct investment in both financial and personnel resources These investments have enabled Humana to implement initiatives to achieve our targets such as an ongoing portfolio-wide LED lighting retrofit, which will result in over $1,080,200 in annual energy savings, as well as continued alignment with our previously developed comprehensive set of design standards for office and clinical operations to ensure consistency, energy efficiency, and sustainable practices across new builds and renovations Over the course of five years, we invested more than $69 million in building efficiency improvements, optimized our building occupancy rate, and implemented new energy-efficient processes and recycling standards Additional focus on infrastructure projects such as consistent BMS systems in our owned sites will create energy efficiencies We are also exploring renewable energy options to determine opportunity and feasibility toward setting a science-based target Finally, ongoing workspace optimization efforts increase workspace density while also decreasing building vacancies, thereby reducing our physical footprint and alleviating commute burden to reduce energy usage and emissions  

On the whole, energy use reduction and greenhouse gas emissions reduction efforts not only drive progress toward our sustainability goals, but also illustrate to our employees and customers our commitment to reduce GHG emissions and operate as efficiently as possible Employee engagement efforts include a continuing focus on increasing work from home with the understanding that this strategy will have a significant impact on Scope 3 emissions, while providing our workforce greater flexibility and reducing operational demands of our facilities

Our long-term strategy is impacted by potential consequences of climate change such as regulation, natural resource scarcity, facility operational costs and human health impacts Our Workplace Solutions leaders review short- and long-term trends and impacts associated with sustainability and refine our business strategy accordingly For example, Humana's portfolio includes both owned and leased assets where many facility investments are on a long-term basis (up to 10 years) Our sustainable real estate approach ensures these investments take into consideration the long-term impacts of building characteristics on climate change and overall environmental impact, employee wellness, and operational costs

North American Specialty Insurance Company," Therefore, it is important that we also take a long-term view on the risk factors that may have an adverse impact on our portfolio, which includes climate change Hence, sustainability and climate change are essential topics for us Our asset management is committed to sustainability and has a well-defined framework which considers ESG criteria, consistently with the Groups Code of Conduct The overall responsibility for responsible investing lies with the Group Chief Investment Officer, supported by the Head Responsible Investing, and the Asset Management Investment Committee Furthermore, an ESG Advisory Board, formed by representatives of all investment units, legal, compliance and risk management, reports on responsible investment activities in the various investment units, develops and reviews improvement ideas, shares knowledge and monitors implementation progress
The Group Asset Management Standard on Responsible Investments (our internal policy) defines our commitment to sustainability The document outlines the principles for all responsible investing activities which include asset classes, investment manager selection, portfolio monitoring and reporting, voting  and engagement (the last two items through the reference to the Swiss Re Voting and Engagement Standard) Swiss Re's strong commitment to sustainability is also defined in our Group-wide Sustainability Risk Framework This framework is applied to the entire investment portfolio, and enables us to identify and analyse potential ESG risks within an investment The framework consists of two umbrella policies on human rights and environmental protection, and seven policies on sensitive sectors or issues: the defense industry; oil and gas (including oil sands); mining; dams; animal testing; forestry and logging; pulp & paper and oil palm; and nuclear weapons proliferation Each policy contains a number of predefined criteria and qualitative standards that may lead to the exclusion of a company or a country from our investment scope 

Our Asset Management unit applies all mentioned criteria to our investment assets, which may lead to the exclusion of a company or a country from our investment scope if they do not meet these criteria and qualitative standards Our exclusion list is reviewed on a regular basis

As a long-term investor, we consider ESG criteria that may have an adverse impact on the sustainable value of our portfolio, such as climate risk and pollution & waste For the systematic and regular assessment of such ESG criteria, we apply sustainability ratings to our investment portfolio Furthermore, based on Swiss Res commitment to support the transition to a low-carbon environment, we measure the weighted average carbon intensity  of our listed equities and credit portfolio on a regular basis since the end of 2015 
In 2017, Swiss Re's Asset Management received the highest rating for its responsible investment approach (""Strategy & Governance"") as well as for the ""Manager Seclection, Appointment and Monitoring"" section Swiss Re scores among the top 15% of all signatories of the United Nations' Principles for Responsible Investments 
ESG considerations per asset class: 

1) Government bonds
Our largest holding within rates products are government bonds (incl agency) At country level, we have implemented a concept of minimum ESG rating standards considering political risk, human rights, and environmental factors that affect the resilience of countries as part of our ESG practice Investments in government bonds hold an ESG rating of BB or better The detailed information is provided by a specialised research company Assessment results guide our responsible investment decisions to ensure the targeted ESG quality of our government bond portfolio This portfolio is screened against such ESG criteria considerations on a monthly basis The sustainability rating is of particular relevance from the perspective of climate change as it measures not only the overall social and governance situation in a country but also its environmental aspects This allows us to consider environmental management in any country in our investment strategy
 
2) Credit products, listed equities, private equity and real estate
At the end of 2018, approximately 46% of our investment portfolio was managed externally This portfolio comprises mainly credit products, equities and hedge funds PRI signatories manage more than 96% of these assets We look at ESG integration primarily from the viewpoint of generating sustainable long-term returns, which aligns well with our focus on a high-quality investment portfolio As part of our active risk management, we are therefore adopting ESG-based benchmarks in our actively managed credit and listed equity portfolios Active credit mandates are benchmarked against Bloomberg Barclays MSCI Corporate Sustainability indices and listed equities are benchmarked against MSCI ACWI ESG Leaders indices, with portfolio managers assessed against outperformance as well as ESG quality of the portfolio
 


Furthermore, all of our external asset managers have contractual provisions with Swiss Re that specifically relate to responsible investing  
We work closely with the external managers to ensure they consider ESG aspects in their investment processes Before external managers are appointed, we perform thorough due diligence to confirm their compliance with our responsible investment principles This includes ESG considerations in investment decisions and monitoring, as well as a review of the managers commitment to responsible investing After being mandated, the managers individual performances are monitored in line with our Responsible Investment Policy and measured against ESG-related benchmarks The managers are required to report regularly on their responsible investment activities
For more systematic and regular monitoring of the actual integration of ESG criteria into our externally managed portfolio, we have engaged the services of a leading ESG research company We conduct in-depth assessments based on ratings provided by them on a regular basis to analyse the quality of the portfolio and to gain further insight into ESG risk exposures We assess the portfolio on the following criteria that are built-up by the factors mentioned below:
Environmental: Climate Change, Natural Resources Use, Waste Management and Environmental Opportunities;
Social: Human Capital, Product Safety, Social Opportunities;
Governance: Corporate Governance, Business Ethics, Government & Public Policy
Results are used to better understand the implications of incorporating ESG considerations into our investment decision-making process and to further improve the quality of our investment portfolio
In 2016, we started to divest from companies that generate 30% or more of their revenues from thermal coal mining or that use at least 30% thermal coal for power generation The decision was taken to mitigate the risk of coal related assets becoming devalued or stranded over the long-term The decision resulted in over USD 13 billion divestments and a significant decrease in carbon intensities in both the credit and the listed equity portfolios For more information, please see Swiss Re's Annual Report 2018, p 174f
We recently also developed and implemented a policy covering mining companies that produce 20m tons of coal per year or more, and existing power generation capacity with installed coal-fire capacity of at least 10 GW, which has not yet been publicly stated
 
Furthermore, we actively contribute to a low carbon economy by investing in the growing SSA (sovereigns, supranational and agencies) green bond market, primarily relying on ICMA's Green Bond Principles As part of our commitment to sustainability, we also invest in green bonds in our credit mandates, as well as renewables and social infrastructure in our infrastructure private debt mandates Debt raised through green bonds is used to finance environmental responsible projects that provide clear benefits from that perspective In 2018, we achieved our target of having a green bond portfolio worth at least USD 15 billion Swiss Re is committed to act as an advocate of long-term investments in infrastructure, as reflected by collaborating with, and advising, the World Banks recently established Global Infrastructure Facility Infrastructure debt is an attractive asset class for a long-term investor like Swiss Re Improving energy efficiency and developing low-carbon technologies, including renewable energy sources, are critical to reducing carbon emissions and securing future energy supplies Renewables and social infrastructure investments are therefore the largest sub-sector in our infrastructure mandate with 21% in renewable energy and 23% in social infrastructure

In Swiss Re's real estate investments, sustainability criteria play an essential role We apply ambitious sustainability standards For projects in Switzerland, the applicable criteria are defined in the Energy Mission Statement of Swiss Re This stipulates that all new buildings need to conform to the MINERGIE standard (wwwminergiech), a Swiss quality label specifying high levels of energy efficiency and superior user comfort When an existing building is due for renovation, this standard applies whenever it is feasible from an architectural, technical and financial point of view In Q2 2018, the combined value of our MINERGIE®-certified buildings reached USD 04 billion, or 23% of our Swiss portfolio of direct real estate investments  Furthermore, we also invest in the US, UK and Australian real estate markets, reaching a total size of USD 17 billion by the end of 2018
The investment managers approach to sustainability includes GreenGuide: Sustainable Property Operations, a best practice guideline for sustainable and efficient real estate operations; ULI GreenPrint Foundation, a global environmental management platform; and LEED Certification from the US Green Building Council The US portfolio is also benchmarked against GRESB, a relative benchmark reliant on performance of all submitting entities The portfolio outperformed the GRESB average of 68/100 with a score of 78/100

Dearborn Natl Life Ins Co, We have a Business Continuity Management Team responsible to respond to any unforeseen event that would threaten the continued day to day operation of our business,7
Erie Family Life Insurance Company," This includes a discussion of severe weather conditions or other catastrophic losses

ERIE has also disclosed climate change as an emerging risk within its Own Risk and Solvency Assessment (""ORSA"") report This report is reviewed annually with the Board of Directors and filed with state regulators

ERIE has also performed a risk assessment that identified the various impacts climate change could have on its business This report was reviewed with the Board of Directors",6
Indemnity Ins Co of North America," Risks are evaluated at least annually at three governance levels, with the companys senior management actively engaged in each The companys Risk and Underwriting Committee, product boards and risk-related committees meet as frequently as monthly to evaluate specific risks and risk accumulations in Chubbs business activities and investments, while the Board of Directors Risk and Finance Committee meets regularly with company management At the Board level, the Nominating & Governance Committee charter has been amended to incorporate provision for review of environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues, including climate change Various risk-related reports are provided at least quarterly to business division management, product boards and other risk-related committees, senior management, the Risk and Underwriting Committee, the Risk and Finance Committee, as well as the full Board

The companys risk management process identifies all known and emerging risks that could have a significant impact on Chubbs overall capital levels and financial results Our analysis of the impact of various risks ranges from the known, based on definitive historical loss experience, to the hypothetical, where we use a calculation called probable maximum loss (PML) that relies on modeling based on various assumptions Regarding the potential effects of catastrophe losses, we continue to closely monitor our catastrophe risk accumulation around the world In addition, we use catastrophe modeling packages reliant upon meteorology and engineering assumptions to simulate and estimate hurricane losses 

In its 10-K filed each year with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Chubb discloses risks that could have a material impact on the companys results of operations or financial condition, and identifies the occurrence of natural disasters as a key business risk The disclosure further notes that climate conditions may be changing, primarily through changes in global temperatures, which may increase the frequency and severity of natural catastrophes and the resulting losses in the future We cannot predict the impact that changing climate conditions, if any, may have on our results of operations or our financial condition Additionally, we cannot predict how legal, regulatory and/or social responses to concerns around global climate change may impact our business The occurrence of claims from catastrophic events could result in substantial volatility in our results of operations or financial condition for any fiscal quarter or year

Chubb has been a leading proponent and user of catastrophe models to quantify natural catastrophe risk for product pricing, risk management and capital allocation purposes Chubb uses these models to aggregate and monitor its natural catastrophe exposures across its portfolio and to ensure that its capital base is sufficiently strong to meet the expectations of regulators, rating agencies and policyholders and to provide shareholders with an appropriate risk-adjusted return Chubbs risk management modeling and underwriting practices continue to adapt to the developing risk exposures attributed to climate change For example, due to the fact that Earths climate appears to be changing in ways inconsistent with the historical record upon which catastrophe models draw data, Chubb has adopted a more short-term view of event frequency that proprietary catastrophe modeling tools address as part of their underwriting process, and we strictly regulate the concentration of those risks we are willing to underwrite 

Chubb also incorporates risk mitigation services through its risk management and site surveys; specification of terms and conditions in policies; and the development of sound underwriting guidelines into the underwriting of catastrophe-exposed products (eg, property, energy, marine or crop coverage) Chubbs modeling and underwriting approach allows for risk differentiation  and hence price differentiation  across our client base Clients that mitigate risk  through retrofitting buildings to comply with updated building codes, installation of hurricane shutters and relocating exposures away from coastlines and floodplains  will have lower insurance costs than those that do not Chubb also makes use of terms and conditions to ensure appropriate risk selection and potentially reward certain policyholder behavior 

The company is also actively engaged with regulators to ensure that pricing is actuarially sound and can be adapted to meet new and emerging climate change risks and the capital implications of these risks For Chubb to continue to offer coverage under climate change conditions, pricing must always be set at sound actuarial rates that cover loss costs, expenses and risk margins on exposed capital

Victoria Automobile Insurance Company," NWIs primary responsibility is to adhere to the investment and compliance policies established by its clients In accordance with the investment policies of the clients, NWI has a duty to assess the risks and opportunities of potential and current investments, which include those arising from climate change Therefore, NWIs credit research team considers both climate change and environmental regulations and disclosures along with many other factors in its assessment of the business risks and opportunities of all current and potential investments NWI also considers the effects of legislative action at the portfolio level when allocating funds across asset classes The potential long-term effects of climate change are considered in a number of ways across the asset classes where NWI actively invests on behalf of its clients

Some examples:
	For real estate/commercial mortgage loan investments, the potential impact of climate change factors into the evaluation/underwriting process by considering proximity to coastal areas and increased risk of tropical storm damage
	For municipal bond investments, the ability of the bond issues (ie municipality) to repay debt is largely influenced by the health of its local economy and stability of its population (tax) base Climate-change issues ranging from water scarcity in the Southwest to coastal migration in Florida are considered when evaluating potential investments
	For corporate bond and equity investments, we review a companys policy and practice to manage climate change and environmental risks in order to assess their potential impact on overall credit worthiness We also actively monitor industry sectors that are more sensitive to climate change and environmental risks

When assessing and managing all of these risks, we consider overall company financial exposure, including insured coverage, not just investment risk
